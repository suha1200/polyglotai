This assessment helps\norganizations identify gaps and set realistic goals for enhancing\ntheir performance.\nEstablishing a Common Language – CMMs create a\ncommon language and shared understanding within an\norganization and across industries.

It is how the organisation behaves and how it interacts\nwith people. This level of ethics has explicit and implicit\ncomponents. The explicit is clearly stated by management,\nwritten down and understood to be ‘correct’ behaviour. The\nimplicit is not written down but is nonetheless understood to\nbe the ‘way things are done’.\nAs with personal ethics, this middle level should cultivate\na sense of responsibility for how the organisation’s actions\nimpact on the world.\nSystem ethics is concerned with how the overall economic\nand social systems behave, how it interacts with people.

In this\nrespect his ideas coincide with those of far distant Lao Tzu, the\nancient Chinese philosopher who wrote the Tao Te Ching.\nA central point in Stoic philosophy is the active relationship\nbetween the laws of Nature that rule the Cosmos, and human\nfree will. A wise person derives maximum benefit and\nhappiness in life by bringing his or her will into harmony with\nNature. They come to know themselves, recognising that their\ninner nature (microcosm) is a representation of the outer\nmacrocosm, or universe; it the same nature in both, only\ndiffering in scale.\nStoics conceived of the universe as being governed by Logos,\nwhat we today would think of as the Laws of Physics. Pure,\nabstract, these laws pervade the universe and make it behave\nin the way it does. The same informing principle resides in\nhumans. Virtue is therefore gained by recognising this and\nworking to harmonise one’s inner self with the qualitatively\nsimilar outer world.\nThe Greek founders of Stoicism conceived of three\ninterrelated elements that collectively make Philosophy. These\nare logic, physics, and ethics. Logic allows us to recognise truth\nwhen we see it, and to avoid making mistakes.

Accessibility & Inclusion\nThe Digital Divide\nThe digital divide is the gap that exists between those who\nhave access to digital technology and the internet, and those\nwho do not.

It can also increase\nsocial isolation, disadvantage, and inequality.\nThere are ways to bridge the digital divide and promote\ndigital inclusion. Digital inclusion means ensuring that\neveryone can access, afford, and use digital technology and the\ninternet effectively. It also means helping people develop their\ndigital ability, which is the knowledge, skills, and confidence to\nuse digital technology safely and creatively.\nHow to Measure Digital Inclusion\nOne way to measure digital inclusion is to use the Australian\nDigital Inclusion Index (ADII).

People in\ncapital cities are more likely to be online than those in regional\nareas, and unsurprisingly, low-income earners struggle to\nconnect. There are different reasons for the digital divide –\nmany older Australians lack online literacy, while in some areas\na lack of infrastructure limits options.\nBridging the Digital Divide\nBridging the digital divide requires a collaborative effort from\nvarious stakeholders, including governments, businesses,\ncommunity organisations, educators, researchers, and users\nthemselves.

This is a legal factor because there\nare Australian laws which govern contracts.\nFactor 2, Copyright infringement In the case study, Luke\nhad been working at a second company, Tangential Software.\nLuke was working on a web portal project like the one he\nhad worked on with TT INTERACTIVE but for Charleston\ntechnical university. Luke used the work from the Altiora\nproject and altered it superficially, effectively copying the work\nhe and others had worked on at TT INTERACTIVE.

Society does not like cheaters\nand thieves. By copying the Altiora project without crediting\nTT INTERACTIVE, Luke effectively stole the project and\ncheated TT INTERACTIVE and its employees. Luke\nVandenberg is a member of society; he should have\ncontributed to society. Instead, Luke behaved like a parasite,\ntaking without giving credit or giving back to the organization\nhe was once a part of.\nFactor 6, Luke was treated poorly at TT INTERACTIVE\nLuke was made to work long, hard hours whilst working at TT\nINTERACTIVE. Luke had mixed feelings about his time at\nTT INTERACTIVE. Luke was getting good experience but\nhe felt that he was worked too hard for his minimum wage. TT\nINTERACTIVE worked Luke very hard which could have\nmade Luke feel oppressed. This is a social factor because\npeople in society usually resent those whom oppress them or\ntake away their freedom. Society has a general dislike for bullies\nlike TT INTERACTIVE."}

Luke breached this\ncontract by making off-site backups. This is a social factor\nbecause society generally does not like it when people break\npromises. For example when a government party promises to\nlower taxes and does not deliver on the promise, people in\nsociety become resentful towards party.\nFactor 8, Luke’s boss pressured him Luke’s boss at\nTangential asked him to use whatever he had learned from the\nprevious project. Luke felt that his boss’ manner was odd. This\nwas because the boss knew about Luke’s copy of the Altiora\nweb portal project and was suggesting that Luke copy this\nwork for the new Tangential web portal project. This is an\nemployment factor because Luke’s boss suggested he take part\nin an un- professional act.\nFactor I, Luke was misled Luke was told that there would\nprobably be a place for him at TT INTERACTIVE after he\nfinished his university degree however TT INTERACTIVE\ndid not have a place for him.

This is a personal factor\nbecause Luke’s personal environment was once at Altiora\nUniversity and universities are very strict on plagiarism.\nFactor 11, Luke was from an I.T (Information Technology)\nbackground Luke made off-site copies of the Altiora web\nportal project whilst at TT INTERACTIVE. Luke made\nthese copies because he wanted to make sure he did not lose\nhis work. Also when Luke copied TT INTERACTIVE’s web\nportal he said to himself, “Why reinvent the wheel?” These are\npersonal factors because they come from Luke’s information\ntechnology background.\nFactor 12, Peer pressure Luke’s boss at Tangential subtly\ntold Luke to copy what he could from TT INTERACTIVE’s\nweb portal project. This is a personal factor because Luke’s\nboss applied peer pressure on Luke. It is part of what caused\nLuke to copy TT INTERACTIVE’s web portal project.\nIntrinsic Factors\nFactor 13, Luke’s personal gain Luke wanted the new project\nwith Tangential to go successfully as this may lead to Luke\ngetting ahead in the industry. Luke had ambitions to open\nhis own studio in the hopes of earning enough money so he\nand his wife could move into a larger home.

This is what led him to making off-line backups of the\nAltiora web portal project. This is an intrinsic factor because\nit is to do with Luke’s own experiences and it is part of who\nhe is as a person. Factor O, Luke’s mixed feelings toward TT\nINTERACTIVE Luke had mixed feelings about working at\nTT INTERACTIVE and felt he was taken advantage of. This\nis an intrinsic factor as it is part of Luke’s own experiences and\nLuke may have felt negatively towards TT INTERACTIVE\nbecause of it.\nSample Solution 2\nLegal factors\nThe first subject I have in this list of legal factors is the\nintellectual property theft. The reason I have chosen this as\nthe first legal priority is because while Luke was working at\nTT he was taking backups of his work off site which is legally\nthe property of TT. Although he may have been under the\nassumption that he was doing the right thing for TT by\nmaking off site backups, it does not eliminate the fact that\nbeing ignorant of the law does not make it ok to break the\nlaw. The second legal factor which is still within relation of\nthe first is the breach of agreement that Luke has committed.\nBeing employed by TT and gaining the work experience he was\nachieving I’m sure Luke could have been intelligent enough"}

The third legal factor is\nwhen Luke breached the privacy legislation. The time he was\nhaving a few drinks then he had mentioned to the Tangential\nmanager that he still had backups of the work he done when\nhe was working at TT interactive. This act is highly unethical.\nThis action has created a negative reaction further down the\nlines when the Tangential manager calls him in for chat about\nthe new project of the portal. The fourth is confidentiality as\nat the point when without hesitation Luke used his original\nbackups from TT as the framework for his new project with\nTangential & spoke to his boss about the work he had done\nwith TT. The fifth legal factor is that Mr Vandenberg has\nbreached his own Code of ethical conduct as he had\ncommitted the above breaches mentioned and never owned up\nto his mistake hence decreasing the integrity of himself. The\nsixth legal breach that has been committed is piracy at the time\nin the case study when Luke used the framework from TT as\nthe framework for Tangential web portal.\nProfessional factors\nThe night that Luke was having few drinks with his manager\nfrom Tangential & he mentioned that he still had backups\nof the work he had done while he was employed by a rival\ncompetitor at TT interactive.

Could this be the reason Luke was given the\nopportunity to be the Lead worker of this project?\nEmployment and Social factors\nDespite Luke received disparaging comments from fellow\nstudents he was still justifiably happy with the web portal\nproduced by TT. The time Luke was working at TT\nINTERACTIVE he was doing long hours and earning the\nbase wage minimum. The justification of this circumstance\nwas that the fact that the experience he is receiving is much\nmore treasured. However Luke still felt underappreciated and\nwhat some could say being de humanised slightly.

It\nwill take a long time for the world to change because there\nis immense inertia built-up in the system, but the observable\ntrend suggests that the change will come in time. Perhaps not\nsoon enough for some but come it will.\nIn practical terms, where does this leave us now? We\ncurrently live in a world where war is still a reality. There are\nbad actors who would go on the offensive unless their intended\nvictims are well-defended. If nations are going to safeguard\ntheir interests, there will be a continuing, though hopefully\nlessening need for military technology to support this\nimperative.\nSeven questions\nProfessor Singer suggests these seven questions to help a\ntechnologist decide what an ethical course of action is:"}

From whom is it ethical to take research and\ndevelopment money? From whom should one refuse to\naccept funding?\n2. What attributes should one design into a new\ntechnology, such as its weaponization, autonomy or\nintelligence? What attributes should be limited or\navoided?\n3. What organizations and individuals should be allowed to\nbuy and use the technology? Who should not?\n4. What type of training or licensing should the users have?\n5. When someone is harmed because of the technology’s\nactions, who is responsible? How is this determined?\n6. Who should own the wealth of information the\ntechnology gathers about the world around them? Who\nshould not?\nAs a general principle, the abuse of something should not in\nitself prohibit the use of it. The potential for people to abuse\nsomething should not prevent it from being used in non-\nharmful ways. Motor cars and drugs would be two examples\nout of many. Military technology would be another. If the net\ngood outweighs the net harm, a compelling argument exists to\nuse it. Where to draw the line is often unclear. Each case must\nbe considered individually and on its merits."}
