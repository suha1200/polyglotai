Introduction, Ethical Frameworks and Personal Lenses Foundations; Frameworks and Personal Lenses; Key Concepts Foundations From an early age, most people experience the concept of Ethics long before they ever learn that there is a term to describe the concept that they are experiencing. Many individuals might say that the term includes some concept of right vs. wrong, or good vs. evil, and how these concepts affect a person’s behaviors. And maybe, they consider Ethics to be the full collection of a person’s attitude and behaviors and their rightness vs. wrongness. But as we can see, often trying to define one term leads us down a rabbit-hole where we discover that we need to define even more terms! In fact, a large part of the first few chapters of this text will focus on the necessity of defining terms and why it is necessary to have a shared understanding of the critical terms which we use to have discussions about ethics. For example, what do you think is the meaning of the term: Ethics? I’m sure that most folx would be able to come up with their own definition of what they think Ethics means. Take a few moments to see if you can come up with your own definition of what you think the term Ethics means for you… go ahead… we’ll wait. Now that you have your own definition of Ethics in your mind, let’s now consider a follow-up question: How did you come to have this understanding of what you think Ethics means? Did you previously learn a formal definition of the term from a textbook or a dictionary? Did you learn it from some previous class or somewhere else in school? Were you told what the term means from your parents or grand-parents or other family members? Did you learn the term from your religious leaders? Did you read it in a sacred book? Did you learn it from television or the movies? Did you learn it on the Internet? Did you Google it? From social media? From an influencer?"}

Did you learn it from television or the movies? Did you learn it on the Internet? Did you Google it? From social media? From an influencer? Did you as a generative AI tool? Really think about it. Where did you get your understanding of this term? And next, while you contemplate all of the possible places where you might have learned the term, the next follow-up question is this: Whomever provided you with this definition… were they right? Where did they learn it from? Is it possible (… just possible …) that they got it wrong? Who, ultimately, gets to decide – for you – what the acceptable definition of this term Ethics may be? Or, for that matter, who gets to decide – for you – what the acceptable definition of any term is going to be? As you can quickly see, this text will be full of a lot more questions than answers! But it is precisely these questions that will help guide you through thoughtful and insightful discussions about how the ethical aspects of technology are becoming more and more significant every day.

Applicable Ethical Movements • Deontological Ethics (18th Century) Deontological ethics emphasizes duty, rules, and the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions regardless of consequences. This framework provides essential grounding for technology ethics by establishing inviolable principles such as respect for human dignity, autonomy, and rights that must be preserved regardless of technological benefits. In applied technology ethics, deontological thinking helps establish non-negotiable boundaries around issues like privacy, consent, and human agency that cannot be overridden by utilitarian calculations of greater good. • Rationalism (Enlightenment Era, 17th-18th Century) Rationalism emphasizes reason, logic, and systematic thinking as the primary sources of knowledge and ethical guidance. This movement is foundational to applied technology ethics because it provides methodological approaches for analyzing complex technological systems and their ethical implications through structured reasoning. Rationalist approaches help technologists and ethicists develop systematic frameworks for evaluating emerging technologies rather than relying solely on intuition or tradition. • Utilitarianism (18th-19th Century) Utilitarianism judges actions based on their consequences and seeks to maximize overall well- being or happiness for the greatest number of people. This consequentialist approach is highly relevant to technology ethics because it provides frameworks for weighing the benefits and harms of technological innovations across large populations. Applied technology ethics frequently employs utilitarian analysis when evaluating trade-offs between technological progress and potential societal risks, such as balancing AI efficiency gains against job displacement or privacy concerns. • Humanism (Renaissance/Modern Era, 15th-20th Century) Humanism places human dignity, agency, and flourishing at the center of ethical consideration. This perspective is crucial for technology ethics as it ensures that technological development serves human needs and preserves human agency rather than subordinating humans to technological systems. Applied technology ethics draws on humanist principles to advocate for human-centered design, meaningful human oversight of automated systems, and the preservation of human choice and autonomy in technological environments."}

This movement brings essential perspectives to technology ethics by highlighting how technological systems can perpetuate or challenge existing inequalities and by advocating for inclusive design processes. Applied technology ethics incorporates feminist insights to address issues like algorithmic bias, the digital divide, and ensuring diverse voices are included in technological development and governance. • Phenomenology (20th Century) Phenomenology focuses on lived experience, consciousness, and how individuals encounter and make meaning of their world. This movement contributes to applied technology ethics by emphasizing the importance of understanding how people actually experience and interact with technology in their daily lives. Phenomenological approaches help bridge the gap between abstract ethical principles and the concrete realities of how technology affects human experience, informing more nuanced and contextually sensitive ethical frameworks. There are entire courses that could be taken on each one of these broad philosophical movements. But just knowing their names and descriptions can give you a starting point should you should choose to explore them in greater detail. Now, let’s take a quick look at just a few of the historical and contemporary ethicists who have studied, expanded upon, and have otherwise contributed greatly to the pursuit of understanding of applied ethics and summarize some of their major propositions and how they might approach ethical issues related to technology today. Ethicists and Their Approach to Technology Ethics • Immanuel Kant (Deontological Ethics) ◦ Ethical Center: Kant's ethical philosophy is grounded in the \"Categorical Imperative,\" asserting that moral duties are universal and rational, requiring actions that could be applied without contradiction to all individuals and treating humanity as an end in itself, never merely as a means. Morality stems from reason and duty, independent of consequences. ◦ Approach to Technology Today: Kant would scrutinize technological advancements through the lens of human dignity and autonomy, insisting that AI, data collection, and automation must never instrumentalize individuals.

His approach emphasizes breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and building knowledge from foundational principles through careful reasoning. ◦ Approach to Technology Today: Addressing contemporary technology ethics, Descartes would advocate for systematic, step-by-step analysis of technological systems, demanding clear logical justification for each design choice and rejecting technological implementations based merely on convenience, profit, or popular opinion without rigorous ethical reasoning. • John Stuart Mill (Utilitarianism) ◦ Ethical Center: Mill's ethical center focuses on maximizing overall happiness and well- being while protecting individual liberty, emphasizing that the greatest good for the greatest number must be balanced against the fundamental importance of personal freedom and self- determination. His harm principle argues that society can only restrict individual liberty to prevent harm to others, creating a framework that values both collective welfare and individual autonomy. ◦ Approach to Technology Today: When applied to technology, Mill’s ideas guide ethical evaluations of innovations like autonomous vehicles or predictive algorithms, helping to weigh benefits (e.g., safety, efficiency) against societal costs (e.g., job loss, privacy erosion). • Martha Nussbaum (Humanism) ◦ Ethical Center: Nussbaum's ethical center emphasizes human capabilities, dignity, and flourishing, arguing that societies should be structured to enable all individuals to develop their full human potential across multiple dimensions of well-being. Her capabilities approach focuses on what people are able to do and be, rather than just material resources, emphasizing the importance of agency, practical reason, and meaningful relationships. ◦ Approach to Technology Today: Approaching contemporary technology ethics, Nussbaum would evaluate digital systems based on whether they enhance or diminish human capabilities – supporting technologies that expand access to education, meaningful work, and social connection while opposing those that create dependency, reduce critical thinking, or undermine human agency and authentic relationships.

Her work highlights how ethical reasoning often involves understanding particular situations and maintaining relationships rather than applying universal principles, and she emphasizes the importance of listening to marginalized voices, especially women's moral perspectives. ◦ Approach to Technology Today: In addressing technology ethics today, Gilligan would focus on how digital systems affect relationships and care networks, advocating for inclusive design processes that center the experiences of marginalized users and questioning whether technologies strengthen or weaken our capacity for empathy, care, and authentic human connection. • Don Ihde (Phenomenology) ◦ Ethical Center: Ihde's ethical center focuses on human-technology relations and how humans and technologies mutually shape each other's existence, arguing that we cannot understand human experience without examining our relationships with technological artifacts. His postphenomenological approach emphasizes that technologies are neither neutral tools nor autonomous forces, but rather extend and transform human capabilities while simultaneously shaping how we perceive and act in the world. ◦ Approach to Technology Today: Approaching contemporary technology ethics, Ihde would analyze how specific technologies – from smartphones to AI systems – alter our ways of being-in-the-world, advocating for careful attention to how digital interfaces change our perceptual habits, social relationships, and bodily engagement with our environment, while emphasizing that ethical evaluation must consider the concrete, lived experience of human- technology interactions rather than abstract technological assessments. As you review the descriptions above and the works of these (or other) historical and contemporary ethicists, you will quickly discover that there are not singular, universally accepted definitions for the terms that are used to discuss ethics.

It is highly suggested that everyone who utilizes this text (instructors and students alike) prepare their own supplemental Full Disclosure section (found below) to help you to identify and understand your own personal frameworks and personal lenses. This will greatly facilitate future topic discussions. Full Disclosure: Your textbook author is a 61-year-old, white, cisgender, heterosexual married man. He was born and raised Catholic and went to Catholic elementary and high schools. He grew up in the Midwest of the USA in a lower-middle-class household within a homogeneous neighborhood (re: ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status). He has been married to his wife, Kim for 40 years and they have no children by choice (… except for dogs… there will always be dogs!) Your author currently consider himself to be in the middle class on a socioeconomic scale. While your author does have some minor health issues and wears glasses to correct his vision, he would consider himself non-disabled. He is no longer a Catholic and identifies instead as an agnostic. Your textbook author initially earned a Certificate of Proficiency in Data Processing in the late 1980s. This credential allowed him to begin a decades-long career in Information Technology. Much later on, he earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology with a Minor in Computer Science after having already been actively working in the field for over 20 years. In 1995, he started his own computer consulting firm which is still active today. In the mid-2000s, he earned a Master’s Degree in Computer Science so as to facilitate his transition into full-time teaching at colleges and universities.

And, as a matter of practice, whenever I attempt to think about the ethics of a given situation or technology, I try to actively take a step backwards and try to view the situation through all of the lenses that make me who I am. It can be very enlightening when I discover, “… Oh! That is where my attitude about this particular thing is coming from!” Sometimes, this type of introspection leads me to be able to say, “Wait a minute! It isn’t ME that thinks this particular way about this particular thing… Rather, I was taught/told/indoctrinated/instructed to think this particular way about this particular thing! And now that I really think about it – for myself – I realize that I am actually free to choose how I actually think about this thing – all on my own!” So, I offer up my own details here just so that you will have a good understanding of the framework that I am using to present and discuss the various concepts we cover throughout the rest of this text.

As you engage with the concepts and case studies in this textbook, it is important to recognize the unique set of experiences, values, and perspectives that shape your own ethical viewpoints. In this text, we will call these perspectives your personal lenses. Honest self-reflection can help you become more aware of your own assumptions and biases as you look through your personal lenses, allowing for more thoughtful and inclusive ethical reasoning. To help us consider these personal lenses, consider this internet meme: Figure 3: Truth perceived from different perspectives The person standing near the orange light source and looking at the shadow only might say that the shape making this shadow is a square or a cube. And from their perspective at that moment in time, this may seem to be true. But the person standing near the blue light source and looking at the shadow only might say that the shape making this shadow is a circle or a sphere. And, once again, from their perspective at that moment in time, this too may seem to be true. Page 12 of 125 2. Introduction, Ethical Frameworks and Personal Lenses"}

Understanding that there may, in fact, be a difference between ‘Truth’ as defined with a capital ‘T’ when viewed from an objective perspective, as compared to what appears to be ‘true’ from our own unique perspective at any moment in time, may help us think more critically about the importance of understanding our own personal lenses. Consider asking yourself the following questions: • What aspects of my background (such as age, race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic status, education, or geographic location) have most influenced the way I see the world? • How did my family, community, or culture shape my attitudes toward technology, authority, and ethics? • What are my core values, and where did they come from? Have any of my values changed over time? If so, why? • Are there beliefs or viewpoints I hold mainly because they were taught to me, rather than ones I have critically examined for myself? • How do my personal experiences with privilege or marginalization affect the way I interpret ethical dilemmas? • Have I ever changed my mind about a major ethical issue? What prompted that change? • In what ways do my current roles (student, employee, family member, etc.) influence my perspective on ethical questions? • Are there perspectives or experiences I am less familiar with? How might I seek out and learn from voices different from my own? • When I encounter a viewpoint that challenges my own, how do I typically respond? Am I open to reconsidering my position? • What steps can I take to recognize and address my own biases as I study Ethics in Technology?

Consider this initial internet meme: Figure 4: 6 vs. 9 as evaluated from one's own perspective This meme, similar to the one shown in the Figure 2 earlier in this chapter, illustrates how the same ‘Truth’ (with a capital ‘T’) can actually represent two significantly different ‘truths’ when one only focuses on their own personal lenses and their own current perspective. In fact, the caption within this meme attempts to establish the importance of trying to help the viewer consider what the other perspectives may look like. But is this easy to do? Consider, for example, all of the personal lenses that this textbook author shared in the previous section. Will I ever be able to realistically look at (or more rightly so – even imagine) any situation through the lenses of a non-white, economically struggling, lesbian, Baptist, still wanting to finish their GED someday…? My personal lenses are so significantly different than their lenses – and yet we may be looking at the exact same situation. But is this realistic? Is it realistically even possible for us to completely recognize, understand, acknowledge and then fully contain all of our own personal lenses and our own current, unique perspective? Are we certain that there may not be any residual biases still influencing our interpretation of what we perceive to be both ‘true’ as well as the ‘Truth’? Do I have what it takes to be able to step away from my own personal lenses (without forgetting them or failing to acknowledge them) so that I can try to see through what I imagine another person’s personal lenses might look like? Do I also recognize that my own imaginations of someone else’s Page 14 of 125 2. Introduction, Ethical Frameworks and Personal Lenses"}

How can I go about really trying to understand what another’s personal lenses really look like for them? For me, this kind of effort begins and ends with communications. Finding ways to actually ask another about their own personal lenses and perspectives seems to be a profound beginning. Then, actively listening as they share their own experiences – without judgment – and trying to repeat back your own understanding of what they actually say seems like an effective follow-up. Only after we have a shared understanding of each other’s personal lenses can we really begin to have effective ethical discussions about various technical topics. Now, for contrast, consider this follow-up internet meme that was based on the original theme: Figure 5: 6 vs. 9 reconsidered from an objective view This meme attempts to suggest that ‘Truth’, with a capital ‘T’ exists (a concept that has been heavily debated by many ethicists throughout history!) and can be justly recognized if one simply chooses to step away from their own perspective and view the situation objectively.

Rather, this meme author seems to imply that the value is more-so that one of these people can use this technique to prove the other one wrong! For this unknown meme author, it’s not about empathy but rather it is about winning. Key Foundational Concepts As you continue deeper into this text, you will discover there are a number of key concepts that are used repeatedly to help facilitate greater discussions and understandings of the various topics. This list will also serve as a preview of some of the upcoming chapter concepts. • Definition of terms – Whenever not previously defined, new critical terms will be defined at each introduction so as to present what I, as the author, am using as the definition of each given term. This does not mean I am claiming supreme authority regarding the term! Rather, it is the starting point from which you can determine if you agree with the definition or not and what, if any, compromises might need to be made so as to have a meaningful discussion. It is imperative that individuals who intend to have meaningful interactions at least have a shared understanding of the terms being used – if not full agreement regarding the terms! • Technology can be found almost everywhere – If you are reading this text, it is most likely that you are already familiar with very many forms of technology. For the vast majority of individuals, the year 2025 is synonymous with technology being integrated into almost every aspect of our existence. And as such, technology is often taken for granted without full consideration of any potential ethical considerations of that tech. For example, how often do we think about how a particular piece of tech was developed or created"}

And as such, technology is often taken for granted without full consideration of any potential ethical considerations of that tech. For example, how often do we think about how a particular piece of tech was developed or created or distributed? Do we ever wonder just who has access to that tech and who does not have access? Are there any unintended uses of the tech that we should be thinking about? • The rate of change of technology is NOT linear – Throughout most of human history, technological change was slow and incremental, with major breakthroughs – like the control of fire, the invention of the wheel, and the development of agriculture – occurring over thousands of years. This gradual pace continued through the Bronze and Iron Ages and even into early modern times. However, beginning with the Industrial Revolution, the rate of technological advancement accelerated dramatically, as mechanization, mass production, and new forms of energy rapidly transformed societies in mere centuries. Now within less than the last 100 years, the emergence of computers, the internet, and digital technologies, have brought an unprecedented surge in innovation and human adoption rates. The current era is unique for its exponentially rapid, transformative impact on nearly every aspect of life. Page 16 of 125 2. Introduction, Ethical Frameworks and Personal Lenses"}

For example, the act of taking another person’s life can be labeled as “murder,” “justifiable homicide,” or “self- defense,” depending on the ethical system, cultural context, or legal tradition applied. What one society or theory may condemn as inherently immoral, another may view as permissible or even obligatory under certain circumstances, illustrating how ethical judgments can range from subtle distinctions to fundamentally conflicting positions. This diversity reflects the influence of different normative theories – such as utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, and cultural relativism – each offering its own criteria for evaluating right and wrong. This illuminates the complexity and subjectivity inherent in ethical reasoning. • Legal and Societal systems attempt to implement a well defined and accepted Ethical system – Legal and societal systems tend to follow a well-defined and accepted ethical system because such alignment provides a consistent moral foundation for laws and policies, ensuring that actions and decisions are guided by shared principles of fairness, justice, and respect for all individuals. This ethical grounding fosters public trust, transparency, and accountability, helping to protect the rights and interests of all members of society while reducing arbitrary or biased decision-making. Ultimately, integrating ethics into legal and societal frameworks promotes social cohesion, supports long-term sustainability, and enhances the legitimacy and effectiveness of institutions by aligning them with the values and expectations of the community. • When considering the Ethics of Technology, the issue is almost never the Technology, but rather the issue is almost always the Ethics – The ethical evaluation of technology often reveals that the core issue lies not with the technology itself, but with how humans choose to use it, as the same contemporary tool can enable outcomes at nearly opposite ends of the moral spectrum. For example, artificial intelligence can be harnessed to improve healthcare diagnostics, enhance disaster response, and promote environmental sustainability,"}

For example, artificial intelligence can be harnessed to improve healthcare diagnostics, enhance disaster response, and promote environmental sustainability, yet the very same AI systems can also be deployed for mass surveillance, autonomous weaponry, or discriminatory decision-making. This dual-use dilemma illustrates that technologies are inherently neutral, but their ethical character is defined by human intentions, societal values, and regulatory choices, resulting in applications that can be seen as highly beneficial or deeply problematic depending on context and use. Thus, it is the ethical framework guiding deployment and oversight – not the technology itself – that determines whether its impact is viewed as just, responsible, or harmful. • With technology, very often science fiction can be viewed as science fact that just hasn’t happened yet – Since the age of radio and television, science fiction authors, movies, and Page 17 of 125 2.

Science fiction has also envisioned self-driving cars, as described by Isaac Asimov, and immersive virtual reality, as seen in \"The Matrix,\" both of which are now active areas of technological development. Even broader concepts, such as global information networks and intelligent digital assistants, were explored in early fiction long before the internet or AI became commonplace. This demonstrates how speculative storytelling has consistently anticipated – and sometimes directly influenced – the trajectory of technological advancement.

Defining Ethics and Related Terminology Why are we here?; Textbook Definitions – the basics; Ethical vs. Legal; Critical Thinking and Limiting Biases Why are we here? Wow! If THAT isn’t a loaded question! But that is exactly what we would like to tackle at this point. Why should we think about this concept of Ethics and how it can be defined and applied to technology? To get our own thoughts germinating, I asked several generative AI platforms (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini) to provide a hypothetical response to this question as written from the perspective of several selected ethicists. Here is what was generated: • Immanuel Kant (Deontological Ethics) \"We must think about ethics in technology because human beings possess inherent dignity as rational agents, and technology must never treat us merely as means to an end. Every technological system embeds moral choices about how humans should be treated, and without ethical reflection, we risk creating tools that violate our fundamental duty to respect human autonomy and dignity. The categorical imperative demands that we only develop technologies whose principles we could will to be universal laws—would we want to live in a world where all technology operates according to the ethical assumptions built into our current systems?\" • René Descartes (Rationalism) \"We must apply systematic ethical reasoning to technology because, without methodical analysis, we build upon uncertain foundations that may lead us astray. Just as I doubted everything to reach clear and distinct knowledge, we must doubt the moral assumptions embedded in our technologies and rebuild them on solid rational principles. Technology amplifies human action, so any errors in our ethical reasoning will be magnified across society —we cannot afford to proceed on mere tradition, convenience, or popular opinion when the stakes are so high.\" • John Stuart Mill (Utilitarianism) \"Ethics in technology matters because technology's power to generate both tremendous benefits and serious harms across vast populations demands careful calculation of consequences. We must evaluate whether our technological choices truly maximize overall human happiness and well-being, while vigilantly protecting individual liberty from"}

Every technological design choice affects whether people can live fully human lives—whether they can engage in practical reason, form meaningful relationships, experience joy, exercise bodily autonomy, and participate in political life. Without ethical reflection, we risk creating technologies that diminish rather than enhance what makes us human, particularly for those who are already marginalized or vulnerable in society.\" • Carol Gilligan (Feminist Ethics) \"Ethics in technology is essential because technological decisions affect relationships, care networks, and the voices that get heard in our society. We must ask not just whether technologies work efficiently, but whether they strengthen or weaken our capacity for care, empathy, and connection with others. Ethical reflection helps us recognize whose perspectives have been excluded from technological design and ensures that we consider how our tools affect the most vulnerable members of our communities, particularly when those voices are often silenced in traditional ethical frameworks.\" • Don Ihde (Phenomenology) \"We must think ethically about technology because humans and technologies co-constitute each other's existence—there is no neutral technology, and every technological relation shapes how we perceive, act, and experience the world. Ethics helps us examine how specific technologies alter our ways of being-in-the-world, sometimes in ways we don't immediately recognize. Without phenomenological reflection on our actual lived experience with technologies, we may inadvertently adopt tools that fundamentally change what it means to be human without conscious deliberation about whether those changes align with our values.\" Did these hypothetical responses from historic and contemporary ethicists actually help you discover or clarify your own reason for being here? For some individuals, simply reviewing what others have previously thought or discovered about a topic can be truly enlightening and inspiring!

So, whichever kind of person you may be, I’d like to re-ask the questions: Why are we here? Why should we think about this concept of Ethics and how it can be defined and applied to technology? Very early in my career, I learned an important lesson that has informed my entire professional and teaching philosophy: When working with adults, if all individuals involved can first understand and agree on ‘the WHY’ of whatever it is that they are doing, then adults tend to be more receptive to fully engage in the related tasks. So, for me, I try to consistently first ask and answer the question, “Why are we doing this again?” before we even get started. For me, the WHY is that, as a technology professional for my entire career, I have seen too often – first hand – what the unethical implementation of technology looks like and what I have perceived to be the harmful ramifications of these unethical situations. And as such, I choose to intentionally explore the ethics surrounding technology so that I can be more prepared to work with students, colleagues and clients as we collectively discover just what the ethical issues might be. This has helped me identify and recognize some of my own biases and has helped me learn how to be more objective in my ethical analysis of new technological advancements. Also, as previously mentioned, the proactive intentional examination of the Ethics of Technology may reward individuals by helping them to feel more prepared when they find themselves required to make decisions or take actions with significant ethical implications.

It is important to not simply dismiss these differences as minor differences in semantics when, in fact, these differences may represent the root cause of major differences in perspectives.

In other words, something can be both Ethical as well as Legal – which many individuals think is the ideal situation. But our shared reality has shown us that the ideal situation isn’t always what we experience. Rather, you may discover that another thing may be completely Legal, while simultaneously being completely Unethical.

We all have probably seen these kinds of situations as these often end up as the Breaking New stories because of their often significant shock factor!

Critical Thinking and Limiting Biases Thinking now about the terms that have been presented in this chapter, what happens when one or more of our personal lenses illuminates a conflict when accepting the definition of a particular term? What happens when an education lens defines a concept one way and that definition is in conflict with a definition previously constructed through a religious lens? What about when a definition changes when viewed through a gender lens vs. using a cultural lens? How about when your family lens defines something one way, but your work community defines that same thing a different way? Do you know how to first identify whenever there is a conflict in definitions? Do you then know how to isolate the differences so that points of agreement and points of disagreement can be fully fleshed out?

Ethics for Tech Developers and Tech Consumers Tech Consumer Responsibilities; Professional Codes; and Everyday Decision-Making Tech Consumer Responsibilities Considering the typical audience for this textbook, nearly 100% of you would most likely consider yourselves to be consumers of tech. Take a few moments to think about all of the tech that you regularly use as a part of your day-to-day experiences. From checking your smartphone for messages and social media updates, to using laptops or tablets for school or work assignments, streaming music and videos, playing video games, and even relying on smartwatches or fitness trackers to monitor your health – technology is woven into nearly every aspect of your daily routine. Whether you’re ordering food through an app, catching up on news, attending virtual classes, or collaborating on group projects using cloud-based tools, it’s clear that tech plays a central role in how you learn, work, connect, and entertain yourselves. What would be some of the ethical considerations for consumers of tech? As a starting point for this discussion, I posed this exact question to a generative-AI tool (Perplexity) to see the response. Here is what Perplexity had to say: “Some key ethical considerations for consumers of tech include protecting personal privacy and data, being aware of how their information is collected and used, ensuring informed consent when using digital services, recognizing and avoiding technologies or companies that engage in discriminatory or unfair practices, respecting intellectual property, and considering the broader social and environmental impacts of their tech use. Consumers should also be mindful of the potential for technology to amplify bias or harm vulnerable groups, and strive to make choices that support transparency, fairness, and accountability in the tech industry.” Interesting indeed! Let’s look at each of these concepts and turn them each into questions for you to review through your own personal lenses: • protecting personal privacy and data – Is your personal privacy and data actually protected?

Do you have any responsibility to not support and enable unethical companies? • respecting intellectual property – Do things like pirating games, software, or music have ethical implications? Does it matter if we’re talking about an artist’s intellectual property or a company’s intellectual property? What about your colleagues’ work? If they didn’t ‘legally’ protect it, is it fair-game? • considering the broader social and environmental impacts – Does it matter that buying the newest version of a phone will mean that the ‘old’ phone may become e-waste with long-term global environmental harm?

Rather, some of you may be heading down a path toward becoming a technology practitioner. As a technology practitioner, all of the previously discussed ethical responsibilities of a tech consumer exist – first and foremost – but there are also additional ethical factors that will be found in addition to those basic considerations. Some common tech-related job titles include the following: • Software Engineer • AR/VR Developer • Data Scientist • Systems Administrator • Network Architect • Cloud Architect • Cybersecurity Analyst • Business Systems Analyst • IT Support Specialist • UI/UX Designer • DevOps Manager • AI Computer Scientist Think of all of the people that you will have an ethical relationship with as a part of your technology-based profession. This diagram represents some of the main relationships you will experience in your IT careers. In your tech-related path, you will find yourself working with very many different individuals who may have many different expectations as to how you will apply ethics in your day-to-day interactions. Think about all of the different people shown here and remember that each person has their own set of personal lenses which they are using (whether intentionally or subconsciously) during each interaction with you. Often, the details of these relationships may be spelled out (at least partially) via various relationship agreements. These agreements can take many forms (i.e. contracts, non-disclosure agreements, license agreements, professional codes of conduct, etc.) with many of these forms having both ethical and legal Figure 7: IT Professionals' Ethical Relationships ramifications.

And, as a result, conflicts can certainly arise when it becomes evident that there are competing interests being considered and viewed through conflicting personal lenses. A great starting point for considering the additional ethical responsibilities of a tech practitioner is to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. This document attempts to codify the ethical responsibilities of tech professionals. But with even a cursory review of this professional code, one can easily discover how conflicts can arise when different constituents prioritize their own agendas related to tech development. Let’s consider the following case study: Case Study: Apple Settles ‘Batterygate’ Class Action Suit with an additional $113 Million1 In November of 2020, Apple agreed to pay $113 million to settle consumer fraud lawsuits. These lawsuits were brought by more than 30 states over alleging that Apple was intentionally and without notice slowing down and shutting off iPhones resulting in the devices having sluggish performance or completely shutting down. At first, Apple denied that it purposefully impeded the devices’ performance in any way. Later, Apple admitted that it did, in fact, alter the devices’ performance but it was for the purpose to “…preserve battery life amid widespread reports of iPhones unexpectedly turning off.” \"Many consumers decided that the only way to get improved performance was to purchase a newer-model iPhone from Apple,\" Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich wrote in the complaint. \"Apple, of course, fully understood such effects on sales.\" The slowdown effected phones that were released between 2014 and 2016, but it wasn’t until December of 2017 that Apple eventually admitted to the slowdowns. Then, they issued an apology of sorts by saying, \"We have never – and would never – do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.\" But they settled anyway! Initially, they agreed to a settlement of $500 Million to pay affected consumers $25 per phone. The $113 Million"}

Maybe too good. But that was then. How will we continue to get new sales if our older products are still working just fine? Why should our customers throw away perfectly good and working devices if they are still working for them? If we don’t continue to have the same (or better) sales growth, my position (and my bonuses) will be at risk. And if the new features of our new devices aren’t so appealing that the consumers won’t willingly abandon their working tech, then we need to make the older devices less-than-desirable if we will have any chance of getting those new replacement sales. But we also can’t disclose what we’re doing because we can’t risk our competitors seeing our strategies. Let’s just find a way to make the old phones ‘go away’.

And for several years now, it has been a great device! But now, for no apparent reason, my regular apps have become unmanageably sluggish and, sometimes, without warning, my phone will just shut itself off. Apple said that it didn’t do anything, but I certainly didn’t change anything! The device was working perfectly, and then all of a sudden, it is no longer functioning the way it should. Isn’t it reasonable to have an expectation that something that is working will continue to work as designed without interruption or performance degradation? Also, when I ask Apple about what’s going on, shouldn’t they have a responsibility to tell me the truth right up front? And if this device no longer works for me, then it won’t work for anyone.

Developer – The boss just asked me to start working on a program that would run constantly – undetectable and behind-the-scenes – that would basically do nothing but would consume a lot of clock cycles of the processor. The purpose of this program is simply to intentionally drain the battery as quickly as possible. I’m no dummy. I know exactly why I am being asked to do this. If I didn’t work here at Apple, and I wrote something like this, I would be considered a cyberterrorist. Am I really OK with being a part of ‘planned obsolescence’? Is this why I went to school to learn how to be an app developer? Is this the kind of app I thought I’d be developing? Is this really what I signed up for? Marketing – The boss just asked me to develop a campaign targeting existing phone users telling them how much they are missing out because their older devices just can’t keep up with the new apps. I’m supposed to focus on new apps that only run on the newest devices. We’ve already seen that the ‘new apps’ aren’t that big of a hit because we aren’t getting a lot of ‘new’ customers at this time anyway. It doesn’t seem to be true that the new Page 34 of 125 4.

When does ‘exaggeration’ become ‘lying’? Is this really what I signed up for? Customer Service – The boss just told us that we are experiencing a huge increase in disgruntled customers because their batteries keep draining very quickly and some phones are just shutting off. The boss told me, “Your response is that the customer is just using technology that is too old and they should upgrade to a newer phone right away” and then I should try to transfer them to Sales. I asked the boss, “What changed? Why have the devices suddenly started failing?” The boss said, ‘That’s above our pay-grade.’ and left me on my own. Something doesn’t seem right here. If I were the customer, I would expect more of a concrete answer. And I certainly wouldn’t appreciate a ‘hard sales pitch’ if the reason I called in was to get my current device restored to the way it was working fine just a bit ago. And why can’t my own company be transparent about what is going on? Is this really what I signed up for? Sales Person – The boss just told me that we will begin using two different sales pitches for our potential customers. First, we have to find out if they are a ‘new’ customer (without one of our previous models.) If so, then we are supposed to first pitch our great Apple brand (be one of the cool kids), and then next we should pitch the differences between our brand and the other brands, and then, finally, we should close with the pitch that the new phones are positioned to handle any new technology advancements that may come in the future. But if the prospect is an ‘old’ customer, then the pitch needs to be just ‘sad commiseration’.

Are you kidding me? How am I supposed to do that with a straight face? Isn’t the reality that this investment is designed to fail in less than 3 – 5 years? Is this really what I signed up for? When looking at this exact same situation through the different perspectives of different involved people, we can see that there are quite a number of ethical considerations that should not be too easily dismissed. One of the most common conflicts when it comes to the ethics associated with business and technology involves the distinctions and differentiations between two different groups of people: stockholders vs. stakeholders.

Their primary interest lies in the financial performance of the company, as their returns depend on stock value and dividend payouts, and they can typically buy or sell their shares at will. In contrast, stakeholders encompass a much broader group, including not only shareholders but also employees, customers, suppliers, and members of the local community, all of whom have an interest in the company's performance and impact, even if they do not own any shares. While stockholders are mainly concerned with financial returns, stakeholders may prioritize long-term stability, ethical practices, job security, product quality, and the company’s social and environmental responsibilities. This means that stakeholders’ interests may not always align with those of stockholders. It has been this author’s experience that the vast majority of corporate boards and executive leadership prioritize stockholder interests over stakeholder interests. So, where does this leave us when we consider how a Professional Code of Conduct can help us in making our ethical decisions? First, this can be something that one can intentionally look for when interviewing for a position with a potential employer. individuals can find out if the organization has adopted the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. Or perhaps they have their own code of conduct that they have developed. individuals can also discover the policies and procedures that the organization uses for dealing with conflicts that arise from competing priorities. Some organizations utilize internal and/or external mediation boards to help provide unbiased, objective reviews and conflict resolutions. Additionally, individuals can adopt their own code of ethics and professional conduct to be a guide for their own, personal decisions. But in order to do this, one should also proactively consider what they may do when they are asked to do something that violates their adopted code of ethics.

The introductory letter from the President and Chief Executive Office (CEO) of Enterprise, Chrissy Taylor, clearly illustrates the ‘WHY’ that Enterprise has adopted and publicly declared their commitment to this Code of Conduct. Figure 8: Enterprise's Code of Conduct Introduction Letter by Chrissy Taylor, President and CEO Contained within their code of conduct, Enterprise shows that there is a clearly defined path that individuals can use (but, more importantly, also have a responsibility to use) to report and resolve issues of ethical concern. This path includes one’s immediate supervisor, a next-level supervisor, the Human Resources department, or the Compliance and Ethics Committee. They even have an ethics hotline which includes a link for online reporting as well as a toll-free number which are both available and monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year! Take a few minutes to review this one company’s published Code of Conduct. Just a few of the topics that you will find covered here include concepts that allow us to also introduce additional terms to be further explored: • Obligations of Leadership – leaders are required to ‘lead by example’ as a requirement of their position. • Copyright, trade secret, patent, intellectual property – creations of the mind that the law defines and protects.

What are some areas that you feel may be in conflict – depending on which personal lenses you choose to use? What are some areas of your own personal code of ethics that may be in conflict with your school, or your work, or your family, or your church, or your community, or your culture? Can you imagine writing up your own, personal code of ethics? What all would be included? What do you feel is still too undefined or situational, so much so that it means that you may not have a consistent ethical response in certain situations? What are the risks of inconsistently or sporadically adhering to a personal code of ethics? Is it OK to change your ethical position on a particular subject? If so, what circumstances would allow for this? As promised in the early chapters of this text… we aren’t providing any concrete, absolute answers to these questions. But rather, we are hoping that by listing a collection of questions, these may help individuals to discover and implement some intentionality into what it means to be an ethical person making informed, ethical decisions in their day-to-day activities.

We also, explored some of your ethical responsibilities as they relate to your role in an organization that utilizes ‘tech’.

Rather, it will be common to discover that there are aspects of each of these subsequent chapters that significantly overlap along with other chapters. Cybersecurity To begin this discussion, once again, let’s use a generative-AI tool (Perplexity) to help us provide the ‘textbook definition’ of cybersecurity. Here is the prompt that was used: “In a single sentence, please define the term 'Cybersecurity'.” Here are the results we received: Cybersecurity – The art and practice of protecting networks, devices, programs, and data from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, or criminal use, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Figure 9: Graphic representing It seems that there may be some significant cybersecurity omissions from this definition: We already have a feel for ‘Why’ cybersecurity is important… But what about the other questions? ‘Who’ is responsible for effective cybersecurity? ‘When’ do we need to think about cybersecurity? ‘Where’ do we need to be cognizant of cybersecurity issues? And ‘How’ do we actually address cybersecurity concerns? So, here is a follow-up prompt for our friend Perplexity: Page 40 of 125 5. Cybersecurity, Hacking, and Digital Identity"}

Assuming that we already know the 'why' associated with a need for cybersecurity, in a single sentence each, what would be the answers to the questions 'when', 'where', 'how', and most importantly, 'who' that should be associated with the concept of effective cybersecurity?” Here are the additional results: When: Effective cybersecurity must be practiced continuously, adapting to evolving threats and technological changes, and is especially critical whenever digital systems, networks, or sensitive data are in use. Where: Cybersecurity is required wherever digital assets exist, including on-premises networks, cloud environments, remote work setups, mobile devices, and any location where information is stored, processed, or transmitted. How: Effective cybersecurity is achieved through a combination of risk assessments, robust security policies, technical controls like encryption and multi-factor authentication, continuous monitoring, regular training, and incident response planning. Who: Everyone with access to digital systems – including individuals, employees, IT professionals, organizational leaders, and specialized cybersecurity teams – shares responsibility for maintaining effective cybersecurity, with organizations often relying on dedicated experts, external consultants, and collaborative initiatives like cybersecurity clinics to strengthen their defenses. The generative AI seems to get this one nearly 100% right! (When we look into the AI systems themselves in greater detail in Chapter 11, we will see this is not always the case!) Everyone is responsible – in part at least – for effective cybersecurity. The following sub-topics of this chapter will explore just a few of the concepts related to cybersecurity where a deeper dive into the corresponding ethics can illustrate some interesting and maybe even unexpected challenges! Vulnerabilities Vulnerabilities in digital systems represent weaknesses or flaws that can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access, disrupt operations, or compromise sensitive information. These vulnerabilities may be targeted through various forms of cybercrime, such as phishing, ransomware, or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, often leveraging exploits that take advantage of unpatched software or misconfigured systems.

Without proper prevention and remediation, threats like viruses, Trojan horses, botnets, logic bombs, or blended threats that can propagate across interconnected networks. The presence of sophisticated threats, such as rootkits or phishing campaigns (including spear phishing, smishing, and vishing, etc.), underscores the ongoing responsibility of cybersecurity professionals and tech users alike to remain vigilant, promote best practices, and uphold principles of fairness, accountability, and non-maleficence in protecting digital assets and identities. Hacking Hacking, in its broadest sense, refers to the act of gaining unauthorized access to computer systems or networks, but the motivations and ethical implications of hacking can vary widely depending on the individuals involved. Black-hat hackers, for example, engage in hacking for malicious purposes such as stealing data, causing disruption, or committing cybercrime, often motivated by personal gain or the intent to inflict harm. In contrast, white-hat hackers use their technical skills to identify and report vulnerabilities, helping organizations strengthen their security by acting as ethical defenders – sometimes as part of formal roles like penetration testers or through coordinated vulnerability disclosure programs like hack-a-thons. The landscape of hacking also includes figures such as crackers, who break into systems to bypass protections or copy software illegally, and hacktivists, who use hacking as a form of protest or to promote social or political causes. The actions of hacktivists can raise complex ethical questions, as their activities may be intended to expose injustice or raise awareness, yet still involve unauthorized access and potential harm to innocent parties. As technology evolves, so too do the methods and motivations of hackers, making it essential for society to continually reassess the ethical boundaries of hacking, the responsibilities of those with advanced technical knowledge, and the appropriate legal and organizational responses to both harmful and beneficial forms of hacking.

Key aspects that make up a person's digital identity include personally identifiable information (PII) like social security numbers, dates of birth, and biometric traits; login Page 42 of 125 5.

Bad actors often seek to access and exploit digital identities through methods like phishing, credential theft, or malware, using the compromised information for identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to sensitive accounts. Once a digital identity is breached, attackers can leverage it to impersonate individuals, commit cybercrime, or even build more convincing attacks against others by harvesting further data from compromised accounts. Ethically, individuals have a responsibility to be intentional and mindful about the information they share and the digital footprint they create, as their digital identity not only reflects on their personal reputation but also affects their privacy and security. Practicing thoughtful self-representation and safeguarding personal data are essential not just for personal protection but also for fostering a trustworthy and respectful digital environment. Online Reputation This leads us to our final concept for this chapter – one’s online reputation. Online reputation refers to the collective perception and judgment that others form about an individual based on their digital presence, including the content they create, share, and are associated with across various online platforms. Unlike digital identity, which is the sum of all information that identifies a person online, online reputation is shaped not only by one's own actions but also by what others post, comment, or tag about them, and is visible to third parties through search engines, forums, blogs, and especially social media. Social media usage plays a significant role in building or damaging online reputation, as posts, comments, likes, and shares contribute to the overall digital footprint, and even a single viral incident can have lasting effects – positive or negative – on how a person is viewed by peers, employers, and the broader public. Also, in today’s society, there is often an ongoing blending of work and personal life which appears to be mostly unavoidable. At work, you may use the corporate computer to prepare for some personal meetings such as with your doctor, etc. Additionally, some organizations have bring-your-own-device (BYOD) requirements and/or policies"}

At work, you may use the corporate computer to prepare for some personal meetings such as with your doctor, etc. Additionally, some organizations have bring-your-own-device (BYOD) requirements and/or policies which stipulate if and how you will use your own devices in the work setting. These kinds of intersections between what is ‘personal’ vs. what is ‘public’ introduces unique risks to one’s online reputation. When individuals commingle work and home information on shared devices, they increase the chances of accidental data leaks, inappropriate content exposure, or breaches that could affect both professional and personal reputations. For example, a security lapse on a personal device used for work could expose sensitive corporate information or inadvertently link personal social media activity with professional contacts, complicating the separation between private and public personas. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are often used to enhance privacy by encrypting internet traffic and masking a user's IP address. However, using a VPN – especially one provided by a third party – Page 43 of 125 5. Cybersecurity, Hacking, and Digital Identity"}

While a VPN can obscure activity from local networks or Internet Service Providers (ISPs), the VPN provider itself can potentially (and usually does!) log user activity. They do this because if the tech fails for any reason, it is only through reviewing the logs that the provider can discover and remedy the failure! As a result of this known logging, both law enforcement as well as sophisticated attackers may still trace actions back to the individual if the VPN is compromised or if endpoints are not secure. Direct-to-endpoint VPNs (such as those connecting directly to a corporate network) offer more control but still do not provide absolute anonymity, highlighting the need for individuals to remain vigilant and intentional about their online actions and the security tools they use. Ultimately, maintaining a positive online reputation requires individuals to be mindful of their digital footprint and the potential consequences of their online behavior. Ethical self-management involves regularly reviewing privacy settings, thinking critically before posting or sharing information, and understanding that online actions can have far-reaching effects on credibility, trustworthiness, and future opportunities.

Technology, Justice, and Social Equity Tech in Education; Healthcare Access and Tech; Tech for Accessibility and Inclusion; Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and Tech; Digital Divide; Tech in Education The integration of technology in education has transformed how students learn, educators teach, and institutions deliver knowledge. From digital textbooks and online learning platforms to adaptive learning software and virtual classrooms, technology can help bridge gaps in access to quality education, particularly for students in remote or underserved areas. However, the ethical considerations are complex: unequal access to devices and reliable internet can reinforce existing educational disparities, and the use of student data for algorithmic personalization raises questions about privacy, informed consent, and potential bias. Educators and policymakers must grapple with the responsibility to ensure that technology enhances learning equitably, rather than exacerbating divides. This involves not only providing hardware and connectivity but also supporting digital literacy, offering accessible content for students with disabilities, and critically evaluating the impact of educational technologies on student well-being and autonomy. Ultimately, the ethical deployment of technology in education requires ongoing reflection on who benefits, who may be left behind, and how to foster a more just and inclusive learning environment. Healthcare Access and Tech Technology has revolutionized healthcare delivery through telemedicine, electronic medical records (EMR), wearable health monitors, and AI-driven diagnostics. These advances can increase access to care for rural populations, streamline patient management, and enable earlier detection of disease. Yet, ethical challenges persist: not all patients have equal access to the internet or smart devices, and the digital skills needed to navigate modern healthcare tools are unevenly distributed. There is also the risk that algorithmic decision-making in healthcare may reflect or amplify existing biases, leading to disparities in diagnosis or treatment. Protecting patient privacy and ensuring informed consent are paramount as more sensitive health data is collected and shared across digital platforms. Ethically, healthcare providers and technologists must work to ensure that technological innovation does not widen the gap between those who can and cannot access high-quality care, but instead promotes justice by making healthcare more inclusive,"}

Assistive technologies – such as screen readers, voice recognition software, and adaptive hardware – can enable people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments to participate more fully in education, employment, and civic life. The ethical imperative is to design technology that is accessible by default, not as an afterthought, and to involve people with disabilities in the design and evaluation process. At the same time, barriers remain: not all digital content is accessible, and some emerging technologies (like AI-powered interfaces) may introduce new obstacles if not thoughtfully implemented. Promoting digital inclusion means addressing affordability, usability, and cultural relevance, while also challenging stereotypes and assumptions about disability. Ethically, the goal is to create a digital world where everyone can participate with dignity and autonomy, regardless of ability. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and Tech Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs provides a useful framework for considering the ethical implications of technology’s role in fulfilling human needs.

Safety needs are addressed through security systems, health monitoring and health care, and emergency communication tools. As we move up the hierarchy, technology supports belonging and esteem through social media, online communities, and platforms for self-expression. It has often been said that we currently live in a time where literally all of the basic needs at the lowest levels of Maslow’s hierarchy could be assured for all people of the world! We already have the technology for production, distribution and re-distribution, monitoring for need, and all associated communication needs, to completely eradicate food insecurity (hunger, thirst and starvation), clothing needs and housing needs (shelter and safety), assure clean air, land and water (pollution removal), health care (diagnostics and treatment) and provide the peace-of-mind and mental wellness that comes from having all of these other needs addressed. The technology isn’t what is getting in the way of achieving all of this! Rather, it is the insistence of holding on to the status-quo of man-made economic systems which favor one economic group to the detriment of all others. This is the only thing that is preventing all of these achievements. It isn’t the tech that is lagging. Rather, it is the socioeconomic constructs that are the root cause preventing the ethical implementation of the tech. Even worse, additional ethical tensions arise when technology is used in ways that actually exacerbate rather than work to address Maslow’s hierarchy needs: for example, when farmers are paid to not produce food to keep prices at an artificial level – all while people go hungry. Or when drug companies are allowed to charge obscene prices for life-saving treatments resulting in millionaire-class executives, while simultaneously standing idly by while poor people die without the treatments.

Digital Divide The digital divide refers to the gap between those who have ready access to computers, the internet, and possess digital literacy, and those who do not. This digital divide is most readily recognized along lines of income, geography, age, and/or ability. This divide often limits opportunities for education, employment, healthcare, and civic participation, reinforcing cycles of disadvantage. Ethically, bridging the digital divide is not just a matter of providing hardware or connectivity, but also of addressing affordability, digital skills, and culturally relevant content.

Fortunately, no employees were ever physically harmed although most have experienced some amount of psychological trauma and many of them have subsequently quit. In fact, it is very hard to find any employees to work because of the continuing threat of being robbed at knife or gun-point. So, the business owner decides that an ideal solution is to simply stop accepting cash! Instead, the owner places signs that says, “No CASH accepted and No CASH on premises.” and “Credit or Debit Cards only accepted.” The owner tells the local news team that they decided to go this route because, ‘… nobody ever robbed a store and asked them to hand over all of their credit card receipts! The cash is the problem.’ The owner said, the technology will allow them to have a safe store once again, and this will allow the store to stay in business. But there is only one problem with this plan… in 2020, New York passed a law that said it was illegal for a business to “not accept cash”. The law stated that its aim was to protect the rights of the ‘unbanked’ and ‘underbanked’ population. The state used, as part of its assertion, the picture of a $1 bill noting the inscription found on each bill of US currency: Figure 11: US $1 bill highlighting 'legal tender' phrase The state argues that it is illegal for anyone to not accept cash.

But, for the moment, let’s not focus on the legal aspects of the case, but rather, let’s think about the ethical aspects of the case. If we look at the situation through the bodega owner’s perspective and lenses, we can potentially see the following: • The owner is trying to make a living and provide for their family while providing goods for their community at reasonable prices. (Maslow’s hierarchy level 1) • The owner needs workers to supplement their own work and keep the store open 24 hours as there are many customers who work all 3 shifts in the neighborhood. (Maslow’s hierarchy level 1) • The workers need to feel safe and the risk of being robbed for cash prevents this. (Maslow’s hierarchy level 2) • A tech solutions (cashless-payments) exists that address the need previously mentioned. • The owner wants everyone to have a cashless payment option and says it is the banks responsibility to give a card to anyone who has cash and let the bank take on the exclusive risk of being robbed for their cash. But now, let’s look at it from the bank’s perspective and lenses: • The bank will only allow for a new account to be opened if there is a minimum original deposit, and a minimum maintained balance, and/or a repeating direct deposit. • The bank claims that this is necessary because the cost of maintaining an account requires these balances. • Meanwhile, the bank has reported that once again this year, the bank has earned record profits and its executives are making multi-million-dollar bonuses. • The bank points to the statement emblazoned on the currency itself and declares – the cash is already here so it’s not our problem.

As we look at this kind of situation through the various lenses of the different individuals involved, it can become pretty obvious pretty quickly that the issues that are causing concern are not the tech! But rather, the issues surround the facts that the socioeconomic systems, and the legal systems, have not kept pace with the changes that have been brought about by tech advancements. And, rather than focusing on the ethical considerations of the situation, our current society tends to put greater focus on the legal considerations that have too often tended to foster adherence to the status-quo. And it is this perpetuation of the status-quo that continues to exacerbate the divides (socioeconomic and technological) which become an ever-widening and unsustainable downward spiral. Efforts to close the digital divide must be intentional and sustained, involving collaboration among governments, private sector, educators, and community organizations. There is also an ethical obligation to consider the environmental and social impacts of technology deployment, ensuring that solutions are sustainable and respect the needs and voices of marginalized communities. In a world increasingly shaped by digital technology, promoting justice and social equity means ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to participate fully and fairly in the digital society.

Technology in Personal and Social Life Digital Relationships; Online Dating; Personal Data Tracking; Digital Minimalism; Technology Addiction Technology has become deeply woven into the fabric of daily life, shaping how individuals interact, form relationships, and manage personal well-being. As digital tools and platforms increasingly mediate everything from communication to leisure, they bring both opportunities for connection and challenges around autonomy, privacy, and mental health. The pervasive nature of technology means that personal choices – such as how much time to spend online or which platforms to use – can have far-reaching effects on social dynamics, emotional resilience, and even one’s sense of self. Navigating this landscape requires a thoughtful approach to the Figure 12: Graphic ethical questions that arise when technology intersects with representation of a digital personal and social spheres. Issues such as the management of footprint digital footprints, the boundaries between public and private life, and the impact of constant connectivity on relationships demand careful consideration. As society continues to adapt to evolving digital norms, individuals must balance the benefits of technological convenience with the responsibility to protect their own well-being and that of their communities. Digital Relationships Digital relationships are connections that are primarily formed, maintained, or deepened through digital communication channels such as social media, messaging apps, online forums, or video calls. Unlike traditional relationships that rely on physical proximity and face-to-face interaction (i.e. in-real- life (IRL), digital relationships transcend geographical boundaries and can develop between individuals who may never meet in person. These connections can be romantic, platonic, or professional, and are often characterized by the use of text, images, video, and other digital media to convey emotion, share experiences, and build trust. While some view digital relationships as fleeting or “throw-away” connections – easily formed and just as easily discarded – others experience profound intimacy and authenticity in their online interactions.

However, the lack of physical cues and the potential for curated online personas can blur the lines between genuine connection and illusion, sometimes causing individuals to lose perspective on the nature and depth of their digital ties. Online Dating Online dating refers to the practice of seeking romantic or sexual partners via internet platforms, typically through dedicated websites or mobile apps that facilitate the creation of personal profiles and digital communication. These platforms allow users to present curated aspects of their identity – such as interests, values, and appearance – and to browse or be matched with others based on compatibility algorithms or personal preferences. The convenience, broad reach, and relative anonymity of online dating have made it a mainstream method for meeting new people, offering opportunities to connect beyond traditional social circles and geographic boundaries. For online dating sites to be considered valuable, they must foster a safe, respectful environment, provide accurate and meaningful matches, and protect user privacy. Features such as robust identity verification, transparent algorithms, and clear communication tools contribute to a platform's credibility and user trust. However, online dating also presents significant risks and ethical challenges. Algorithmic bias can skew matches, reinforcing stereotypes or excluding certain groups, while aggressive data collection and the sale of personal information raise concerns about user privacy and consent. Some platforms may personalize content or matches to such an extent that they inadvertently censor or limit users’ choices, reducing the diversity of potential connections. The prevalence of deceptive practices – including catfishing (posing as someone else), fraudulent schemes, and the creation of fake profiles – can lead to emotional harm or financial loss. These issues highlight the need for ethical oversight, transparency in data use, and robust safeguards to ensure that online dating remains a positive and equitable experience for all users.

Every digital interaction, no matter how trivial it may seem, contributes to a vast and ever-expanding profile of personal data. Companies routinely track direct data points such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, and purchase histories, but the scope goes far beyond this. Indirectly, organizations can derive sensitive information from patterns in browsing behavior, location data from GPS, device fingerprints, app usage, social media activity, and even metadata embedded in videos, photos and messages. By aggregating and analyzing these diverse data streams, companies can infer a person’s habits, preferences, health status, social circles, and even political leanings. Page 55 of 125 7.

Even with just these four data points, the device and associated apps can collect a wealth of additional information. The smartphone’s operating system and apps may automatically log the user’s IP address, device type, language settings, and geolocation. By linking the email address to other online accounts, data brokers can cross-reference social media profiles, public records, and past purchase histories. The date of birth enables age-based profiling, while the country helps narrow down cultural, legal, and economic backgrounds. Meanwhile, passive data collection – such as app usage patterns, movement tracked via GPS, and browsing history – can reveal daily routines, frequented locations, and social interactions. Machine learning algorithms can then synthesize these disparate data points to construct an eerily accurate and invasive profile: predicting the user’s income bracket, relationship status, health risks, interests, and even likely future behaviors. This comprehensive profiling, often invisible to the user, highlights the profound privacy risks and ethical dilemmas posed by ubiquitous personal data tracking in the digital age. Digital Minimalism Digital minimalism is often seen as a response to the overwhelming realities of big-data collection, where every online action contributes to a growing digital footprint that is neither fully transparent nor easily controlled. For some, embracing digital minimalism can resemble “sticking one’s head in the sand” – a knee-jerk reaction to the anxiety and fatigue caused by constant notifications, information overload, and the persistent sense of surveillance. In this light, digital minimalism may appear as an attempt to escape rather than confront the pervasive reach of technology. This is especially apparent when “opting out” entirely is rarely practical (… or even possible…) in a world where digital connectivity underpins nearly every aspect of work, social life, and civic engagement.

Rather than rejecting digital tools outright, digital minimalism advocates for curating one’s digital environment to prioritize high-value activities that align with personal values and goals. Practitioners report benefits such as improved mental clarity, stronger relationships, and enhanced productivity, as they reduce digital clutter and reclaim their attention from low-value distractions. However, the practical challenge remains: even the most disciplined digital minimalist cannot fully escape the data-driven infrastructure that shapes modern existence. Thus, digital minimalism is less about total withdrawal and more about making conscious choices to engage with technology in ways that support, rather than undermine, a meaningful and healthy life.

Like other addictions, those affected may not recognize – or may actively deny – that their technology use has become problematic. Denial is a common defense mechanism, with individuals believing they are in control or rationalizing their behavior as normal, even as they neglect responsibilities, relationships, or self-care. This lack of self-awareness is compounded by the ubiquity of technology in daily life, making it difficult to distinguish between healthy use and dependency. Many app developers and tech companies intentionally design their products to maximize user engagement, leveraging psychological principles such as variable rewards and social validation to create habit-forming experiences. Features like endless scrolling, push notifications, and algorithmic content feeds are engineered to keep users returning, increasing screen time and, ultimately, advertising revenue. There have been high-profile legal actions against major tech firms alleging that their platforms are intentionally addictive, particularly to young users. For example, lawsuits have been filed against social media companies for allegedly exploiting vulnerabilities in children and teens to encourage compulsive use, with claims that these practices contribute to mental health crises. In response, some governments and advocacy groups have called for increased regulation, transparency in algorithm design, and the implementation of features like screen time limits and digital well-being tools. It is their hope and intent that these additional approaches will help users regain control over their technology use. Despite these efforts, addressing technology addiction remains a significant challenge in an increasingly digital world.

Privacy, Surveillance, and Data Ethics Big Data and Privacy; Public vs. Private; Urban Surveillance and Smart Cities; Data Collection and Consent; Cloud Computing; Data Ownership and Open-Source Solutions As our lives become increasingly intertwined with digital technologies, the boundaries between public and private spheres have grown more complex. The preceding chapters have explored how technology shapes our identities, relationships, and access to opportunities, while also highlighting the responsibilities of both developers and consumers in navigating ethical challenges. From the responsibilities of tech users and professionals, to the impact of technology on justice, equity, and personal well-being, we have seen that ethical decision-making is rarely straightforward – often requiring us to balance competing values and anticipate unintended consequences. Building on these foundations, this chapter delves into the critical issues of privacy, surveillance, and data ethics. In a world driven by big data, cloud computing, and ubiquitous connectivity, questions about who owns our information, how it is collected, and for what purposes it is used have become central to the ethical landscape. We will examine the evolving definitions of privacy in the digital age, the rise of urban surveillance and smart cities, and the ethical dilemmas posed by large- scale data collection and consent. By considering the implications of data ownership and the responsibilities of both individuals and organizations, this chapter aims to equip readers with the tools to critically assess the ethical dimensions of privacy and surveillance in contemporary society. Big Data and Privacy The rise of big data has fundamentally transformed the landscape of personal privacy. Every day, individuals generate vast amounts of digital information through online interactions, purchases, social media activity, and even passive data collection via mobile devices and smart home technology. This information is not only collected by the platforms and services individuals use directly, but is also routinely shared with third-party data aggregators, sold to marketers, and analyzed by a wide array of organizations seeking to infer deeper insights about users’ behaviors and preferences.

The sheer scale and interconnectedness of data collection means that a single piece of personal information – such as an email address or geolocation – can be replicated, cross-referenced, and stored in dozens, if not hundreds, of separate databases worldwide. A crude (but conservative) estimate suggests that for any active digital user, there may be hundreds to thousands of copies of their personal data distributed across various entities. Each online service, retailer, social media platform, and app may create its own record; data brokers and aggregators further multiply these records as they buy, sell, and combine data sets; and backup systems, cloud Page 61 of 125 8.

Moreover, big data analytics can infer additional attributes and connections, effectively creating new “copies” of information by extrapolating from existing data points. This exponential proliferation makes it nearly impossible for individuals to fully track or control the spread of their digital footprints. Consider this scenario: A big cell phone provider sells anonymized (de-identified) data points to a data aggregator and analysis group which cover a period of one-week for a particular region. The data was requested because a store in this region wants to learn more about the individuals who showed up for their big sale event. The aggregator starts by focusing on all of the cell phones that went to that particular store during the store’s event. But, they don’t stop there. They then review where the data points go after they left the store to see the other destinations for these devices. They discover that quite a number of phones left the store and went to food establishments. This might suggest that the store should have some ‘snacks’ available during their next sale event. They also discover that a number of the devices went to a competitor’s store… this may be interesting to both the original store as well as to the competitor store. But then, they follow the phones to their ‘final destinations’ for that day to see where they ended up that night. Then, they repeat this process for each day (not just the sale day) to see what else they can learn about the ‘anonymous’ data points. Just by analyzing where the phones end up for the ‘end-of- the-day’ these data points may likely represent the ‘homes’ of the ‘anonymous data points’. And tracking where the phones go each day, they are likely to discover other patterns as well. So much for anonymized data!

It encompasses the right to decide what information is shared, with whom, and for what purposes. In the digital age, however, this expectation is increasingly challenged. The default practices of data collection, the complexity of data flows, and the lack of transparency in how information is shared or sold mean that true control over personal data is often illusory. While privacy remains a foundational value and a legal right in many jurisdictions, the reality is that maintaining a reasonable expectation of privacy online requires significant effort, technical literacy, and often, a willingness to opt out of many modern conveniences. Thus, while the principle of privacy is still widely recognized, its practical realization in the age of big data is fraught with challenges and, for many, may no longer be a fully reasonable expectation without substantial systemic change.

So it seems now we should differentiate between the legal definitions vs. the ethical definitions of the terms ‘Public’ vs. ‘Private’. The distinction between ‘public’ and ‘private’ is foundational both in legal and ethical discussions, yet the definitions and boundaries can shift depending on context. Legally, ‘public’ typically refers to spaces, actions, or information that are accessible or visible to the general population and where individuals have a reduced expectation of privacy. ‘Private,’ on the other hand, denotes areas, behaviors, or data that are restricted to individuals or select groups, where a higher expectation of privacy is recognized and protected by law. Ethically, the distinction often hinges on the reasonable expectations of those involved. Consider the scenario of looking through an open window into someone’s home: while the window may be open and the view technically accessible from a public sidewalk, most people would agree that peering inside or, more invasively, taking a photo or video crosses an ethical line. The act transitions from a passive observation in a public space to an active intrusion into someone’s private life, highlighting how context and intent matter. Similarly, recording audio or video of people inside a grocery store – where there is a general expectation of being in a semi-public space – differs ethically (and sometimes legally) from recording those same people outside on a public sidewalk. The boundaries blur further in places like restaurants, public transportation, or even online forums, where the mix of public accessibility and private interaction complicates the ethical calculus. Additional examples illustrate these nuances. In a workplace, conversations in a private office are generally considered private, while those in a break room may not be. In digital contexts, posting on a public social media page is typically considered public, but sending a direct message is private – though the technical ability to copy, share, or leak messages challenges this expectation.

Even in public spaces, certain activities, such as using a restroom or changing clothes in a locker room, retain strong legal and ethical protections of privacy despite their location. Ultimately, the legal definitions of public versus private are shaped by statutes and case law, often focusing on the impact of actions on society versus individuals. Ethically, the distinction is more fluid, relying on context, societal norms, and the reasonable expectations of those involved. As technology continues to blur these boundaries – through ubiquitous cameras, data collection, and online sharing – it becomes increasingly important to critically examine not just what is legally permissible, but what is ethically respectful of individuals’ privacy and autonomy.

Traffic cameras, for instance, are widely deployed to monitor intersections, enforce traffic laws, and provide real-time data to manage congestion. These systems can reduce accidents and improve emergency response times by allowing authorities to quickly identify and address incidents. Similarly, vehicle tracking – enabled through license plate readers and various connected sensors – can help locate stolen vehicles, optimize public transportation routes, and even support environmental goals by monitoring emissions and traffic patterns. However, these same technologies raise significant concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse. Traffic cameras and vehicle tracking systems can be repurposed for mass surveillance, enabling authorities or third parties to monitor individuals’ movements without their knowledge or consent. This persistent observation can erode the sense of urban anonymity and create a chilling effect on personal freedom, as people may change their behaviors if they feel constantly watched. The aggregation of vehicle movement data, when combined with other data sources, can reveal sensitive patterns about individuals’ routines and associations. Facial recognition technology represents another powerful but controversial tool in the smart city arsenal. On the positive side, it can assist in locating missing persons, identifying suspects in criminal investigations, and enhancing security at large public events. Yet, the deployment of facial recognition in public spaces has sparked intense debate over accuracy, bias, and the risk of wrongful identification. Moreover, the widespread use of facial recognition can enable pervasive government or corporate monitoring, undermining civil liberties and disproportionately impacting marginalized communities. Other notable examples include smart utility meters and environmental sensors. Smart meters can help residents and city officials monitor and reduce energy and water consumption, contributing to sustainability goals and lowering costs.

The risk of cyberattacks, unauthorized data sharing, and the erosion of privacy demands robust governance, transparent policies, and meaningful public engagement to ensure that technological progress does not come at the expense of individual rights and community trust.

Explicit consent requires a clear, affirmative action from the user – such as checking a box, signing a form, or clicking an “I Agree” button – indicating unambiguous agreement to the collection and processing of their data. This type of consent is often accompanied by detailed language in End-User License Agreements (EULAs) or Terms of Service (ToS), specifying what data will be collected, how it will be used, and who it may be shared with. For example, a ToS might state, “We collect your name, email, and usage data to provide and improve our services,” and the company requires the user to actively accept these terms before proceeding. Implied consent, by contrast, is inferred from a user’s actions or the context in which those actions occur. If a user continues to browse a website after being notified of a cookie policy, or submits a contact form expecting a response, their behavior is interpreted as agreement to certain data practices – even if they have not explicitly acknowledged them. Implied consent is often used for routine or less sensitive data collection, but it is inherently less transparent and can lead to ambiguity or disputes over what the user actually agreed to. A critical nuance in these agreements is the use of open-ended language regarding data use. For instance, a clause might state, “We may use your data for purposes such as backups or translation to another language.” The phrase “such as” does not restrict the company to only those listed uses; rather, it leaves the door open for additional, unspecified uses of the data. The stated intent behind this language (if it is ever actually stated) is said by the company to provide flexibility for operational needs. However, it can also be used to mask broader data exploitation. For example, data collected for “service improvement” could be repurposed for targeted advertising, profiling, or even sold to third parties – uses"}

However, it can also be used to mask broader data exploitation. For example, data collected for “service improvement” could be repurposed for targeted advertising, profiling, or even sold to third parties – uses not explicitly disclosed in the original agreement – but made legal through the agreement as written. The concept of intent becomes central here. While a company may claim its intent is benign – such as improving user experience or ensuring data security – the same permissions can be leveraged for more intrusive or profit-driven activities, like behavioral advertising, location tracking, or sharing data with law enforcement or other organizations without further user notification. Other examples include using voice recordings from smart speakers to train AI beyond the stated purpose, or aggregating fitness tracker data for insurance risk assessment, even when the original consent was for personal health monitoring. Legally, the sufficiency of consent – whether explicit or implied – depends on the jurisdiction and the sensitivity of the data involved. Regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) developed and implemented in the European Union, require explicit, informed consent for most personal data processing, especially for sensitive categories, and place the burden on organizations to demonstrate that valid consent was obtained.

In practice, however, the complexity of agreements and the opacity of data flows make it difficult to prove that users have genuinely understood or agreed to all possible uses of their data. Likewise, demonstrating the true intent of a company’s data practices is challenging, as broad or ambiguous language can be exploited for purposes far beyond those originally disclosed. As a result, both proving consent and intent remains a fraught process, highlighting the ongoing need for clearer communication, stronger regulation, and more transparent data practices. Cloud Computing Cloud computing has become deeply integrated into the daily routines of non-corporate users, offering convenience and flexibility across a range of applications. Common examples include file storage and sharing services like Google Drive, Apple iCloud, and Dropbox, which allow users to save documents, photos, and videos remotely and access them from any device. Email services such as Gmail and Yahoo Mail rely on the cloud to store messages and attachments, making communication seamless and accessible from anywhere. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram use cloud infrastructure to let users upload and share photos, videos, and other content. Streaming services, including Netflix and Spotify, leverage the cloud to deliver on-demand entertainment to millions, while cloud-based productivity suites like Google Docs and Microsoft 365 enable real-time collaboration and document editing without the need for local software installations. The primary appeal of these cloud-based applications lies in their promise of accessibility across devices, ease of use, and the ability to synchronize data across multiple devices. Users are drawn to the convenience of automatic backups, the ability to share files instantly, and the reduction in the need for physical storage or device-specific software.

Consider this figure describing ‘the cloud’. If we understand that there is no cloud, but rather, it is just someone else’s computer, we begin to understand that we are just using their computers for storage, and that they are perpetually peeking at literally everything you put up there! Transparency remains a major issue. Once data is uploaded to the cloud, users have little visibility into where it is stored, how it is processed, or with whom it is shared. The lack of clear, accessible information about data practices means that users cannot easily verify how their information is being used or if it is being sold or repurposed for profit. This opacity is compounded by the trend of phasing out traditional, locally-installed productivity software in favor of cloud-based, subscription-only models. Companies are increasingly steering users toward exclusive cloud solutions to ensure recurring revenue, gain greater control over software updates, and – crucially – maintain ongoing access to user data. As a result, users are often left with little choice but to accept these terms if they wish to continue using familiar tools, further eroding their control over personal information and privacy in the digital age. Data Ownership and Open-Source Solutions Data ownership refers to the legal rights, control, and authority an individual or entity has over specific sets of data, including how that data is accessed, used, modified, shared, or deleted. It is about both possession and responsibility, granting the owner the power to determine the fate of the data and to enforce those rights legally and ethically. Data ownership is foundational for accountability, privacy, and security in a world where personal and organizational data are invaluable assets.

These questions illustrate the complexity and spectrum of data formats – ranging from personally identifiable information (PII) like names and fingerprints, to digital content, behavioral metadata, and even biological data. Legally, ownership can depend on jurisdiction, contractual agreements, and the nature of the data, while ethically, many argue individuals should retain primary rights and control over their personal information. Some types of data, such as biometric identifiers (fingerprints, facial scans, DNA) and commonly accessed data (emails, social media posts), are inherently difficult to isolate and protect due to the way they are collected, stored, and shared across platforms and organizations. Once digitized and uploaded, these data types often become subject to broad terms of service that can dilute individual ownership and control. By contrast, data that a user creates – such as documents, code, or media files – can, actually be more readily controlled and protected! Open-source software and personal computing resources provide the mechanisms by which users can take a modicum of control over digital information that they create.

Digital Communication, Social Media, Misinformation and Democracy Social Media Ethics; Cyberbullying and Harassment; Deepfakes; Misinformation; Manipulation; Free Speech vs. Hate Speech; Influencer Culture; Media Literacy The digital revolution has profoundly transformed the ways in which people connect, share ideas, and participate in civic life. This chapter explores how the tools and platforms that facilitate these interactions also raise complex ethical questions that touch on every aspect of our personal and collective existence. The rapid spread of information – and the ease with which it can be shaped or distorted – has forced societies to confront new challenges regarding trust, credibility, and the responsibilities of both individuals and institutions. These dynamics are deeply interwoven with our earlier discussions on privacy, data ethics, and the broader societal impacts of technology. This all serves to highlight the need for nuanced approaches to digital citizenship. As digital spaces become central to public discourse, the boundaries between private expression and public consequence have blurred. The ethical dilemmas introduced here are not isolated; they are amplified by the same technological advancements that enable unprecedented connectivity and innovation. Issues explored in previous chapters – such as the responsibilities of tech developers and consumers, the vulnerabilities of digital identities, and the implications of surveillance – are now seen through the lens of how information is shared, consumed, and manipulated. This chapter examines the ways in which digital communication shapes social norms, influences decision-making, and can both empower as well as undermine democratic processes. It is here that the ethical frameworks introduced at the outset of this text are put to the test, as readers are invited to consider how technology mediates our relationships with each other and with the wider world. Social Media Ethics Social media has redefined how individuals engage with information and with one another, creating a dynamic environment where both users and platforms play crucial ethical roles.

As consumers, people are constantly exposed to a vast array of content – news, opinions, entertainment, and more – often algorithmically curated and designed to maximize engagement rather than assure accuracy. This places a unique responsibility on users to critically evaluate the information they encounter. Ethical participation means more than simply sharing or reacting; it involves considering the potential impact of one's posts and interactions. Users must weigh the value of free expression against the potential harm caused by spreading misinformation, engaging in harmful rhetoric, or participating in online harassment. The rise of digital anonymity can sometimes embolden individuals to act in ways they would not in face-to-face interactions, underscoring the importance of empathy, respect, and accountability in online spaces.

While users must exercise personal judgment, social media companies are tasked with balancing the principles of free speech with the need to prevent harm and maintain a safe, inclusive environment – all while keeping their financial bottom line in mind. This balancing act often manifests in debates over censorship – where does moderation cross the line into undue suppression of ideas? Platforms must also grapple with the challenge of distinguishing between legitimate satire and deliberately misleading content. The expectation of fact-checking is a contentious issue: while some argue that platforms should take a more active role in verifying information, others warn of the dangers of overreach and the potential for bias in content moderation. Ultimately, both participants and platforms share an ethical obligation to foster an online ecosystem that encourages constructive dialogue, protects against harm, and upholds the integrity of public discourse – a challenge that grows ever more complex as the digital landscape continues to evolve. Cyberbullying and Harassment Cyberbullying and harassment are two closely related forms of harmful behavior that occur through digital channels. Cyberbullying is defined as the use of technology – such as social media, messaging apps, or online games – to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person. It often involves repeated actions intended to harm, and can include sending mean or aggressive messages, spreading rumors, posting embarrassing photos or videos, or deliberately excluding someone from online groups. Harassment is a broader term that encompasses any unwanted behavior intended to annoy, threaten, or intimidate another person, and in a digital context, this can range from persistent unwanted messages to explicit threats or hate speech. Both cyberbullying and harassment can have severe emotional and psychological consequences, especially since digital content can be widely and permanently distributed. Examples of these behaviors are numerous and can include cyberstalking, where an individual monitors or follows someone’s online activity obsessively, often with threatening intent; doxxing, which involves maliciously sharing someone’s personal information online without consent; and the distribution of inappropriate material, such"}

Other mechanisms include impersonation (creating fake profiles to harm someone’s reputation), trolling (posting inflammatory or offensive comments to provoke a reaction), and flaming (sending hostile and insulting messages). These actions not only violate privacy but can also escalate into situations where victims feel unsafe in both digital and physical spaces. From a young age, many children and adolescents may be exposed to digital environments where the culture of “trash-talking” – playful or aggressive banter often aimed at opponents in online games – is prevalent.

The anonymity and distance provided by digital platforms can embolden individuals to cross ethical boundaries. As a result, what begins as teasing can easily spiral into targeted campaigns of abuse. Over time, repeated exposure to or participation in such behavior can desensitize young people to the harm caused by their words and actions, making it crucial for both individuals and platform providers to foster respectful and accountable online communities. Deepfakes, Misinformation and Manipulation Deepfakes, misinformation, and manipulation represent some of the most complex ethical challenges in today’s digital landscape. Deepfakes – realistic, AI-generated images, videos, or audio – can blur the line between truth and fiction, with both creative and destructive potential. On the positive side, deepfake technology has been used to enhance public awareness campaigns, such as the “Malaria Must Die” initiative, where David Beckham appeared to speak in nine different languages, helping to reach a global audience. In media, Reuters has employed AI-generated presenters for personalized news summaries, making content more accessible and engaging. Other beneficial uses include voice cloning for individuals with speech impairments, de-aging actors for films, and creating immersive educational or historical experiences. However, deepfakes have also led to significant legal and ethical controversies. Lawsuits have arisen over non-consensual use of individuals’ likenesses – most notably in cases involving revenge porn, where deepfakes have been used to create explicit content without consent, leading to litigation and demands for stricter regulation. High-profile cases also include financial scams, where deepfake voices or videos impersonated executives to authorize fraudulent transactions, resulting in millions in losses and subsequent lawsuits. Celebrities and public figures have similarly pursued legal action against unauthorized deepfake impersonations that damaged their reputations or misled the public. Misinformation and manipulation, meanwhile, are often amplified by automated tools such as bots, which can flood social media platforms with false or misleading content. Bots are designed to mimic human behavior, allowing them to interact with users, post comments, and even “like” or share content en masse. This orchestrated activity can artificially boost"}

The intent is often to manipulate public opinion, influence elections, or sow discord by making fringe ideas appear more widely accepted than they actually are. The combination of deepfakes and bot-driven misinformation creates a potent tool for manipulation, challenging both individuals and platforms to discern fact from fiction in an increasingly synthetic information environment.

In the United States, the First Amendment protects freedom of speech as a foundational right, barring the government from restricting expression based on viewpoint, even when that expression is offensive or hateful. The intent behind this legal framework was to uphold robust public discourse and protect minority voices, recognizing that ethical considerations – such as the need to prevent harm and promote dignity – must be balanced against the imperative of open debate. Over time, courts have clarified that speech can only be restricted if it directly incites imminent lawless action or constitutes a true threat. Despite these legal boundaries, ethical debates persist over what constitutes acceptable speech. Hate speech, while not legally defined in the U.S., is generally understood as expression intended to vilify, humiliate, or incite hatred against a group or class of people based on characteristics such as race, religion, gender, or sexual identity. The challenge arises because the same words or phrases can be interpreted differently depending on the observer’s perspective, cultural background, or personal experience. Can you think of some phrases that have been used by one group as a rallying cry of ‘free speech’ while others attempt to vilify anyone who uses the exact same phrase with accusations of ‘hate speech’? When communities or governments attempt to define and regulate these terms, the result is often confusion, ambiguity, or outright contradiction. The subjective nature of what constitutes hate speech or offensive speech means that any attempt to codify these concepts risks either overreach – suppressing legitimate debate – or underreach – failing to protect vulnerable groups from harm. This tension is heightened in diverse societies, where different groups may have conflicting values and interpretations of what is ethical or acceptable.

Influencer Culture Influencer Culture refers to the social phenomenon in which individuals – both online and off – build communities around themselves and exert significant commercial and non-commercial influence over their followers. This culture is not new: throughout history, prominent figures such as royalty, philosophers, political leaders, and celebrities have shaped public opinion, set trends, and influenced consumer behavior. In the digital age, however, the barriers to becoming an influencer have dropped dramatically, and the speed and reach of influence have expanded exponentially. Before the rise of social media, influencers included figures like Eleanor Roosevelt, who used her newspaper column and radio appearances to shape public opinion and advocate for social causes.

Today, influencers are typically individuals who have built large followings on platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. These influencers often arrive without credentials or any specific expertise. Rather, they excel at social media engagement and, perhaps, have a likable or convincing personality. As influencer culture has grown, so too have debates about the responsibilities of influencers themselves. Some have faced backlash and legal repercussions for promoting harmful products, spreading misinformation, or engaging in unethical behavior. In response, there have been calls – and sometimes legal actions – to hold influencers accountable for the consequences of their actions, particularly when those actions mislead or harm their audiences. This includes demands for greater transparency in sponsored content, as well as accountability for endorsing products or ideas that may have negative real-world effects. The rise of influencers goes beyond mere entertainment. For many followers, influencers fill voids left by traditional institutions, offering advice, companionship, or a sense of belonging that may be missing from their everyday lives. Influencers often create parasocial relationships – one-sided bonds where followers feel a personal connection to the influencer – which can be a source of comfort, inspiration, or even identity formation. This dynamic can make influencers powerful agents of change but also places significant responsibility on their shoulders. Despite the potential for lasting impact, many influencers experience the ephemeral nature of fame. The phrase “15 minutes of fame” is especially apt, as viral success can be fleeting, and the public’s attention is fickle. Some influencers exhaust their popularity through overexposure, scandal, or controversial behavior, leading to a rapid loss of followers and influence. Others “crash and burn” more dramatically, facing public backlash or legal issues that end their careers as quickly as they began.

Media Literacy Media Literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, create, and act using all forms of communication. It goes beyond simply understanding information; it involves critical thinking about the messages we encounter, their sources, and their impact. Media literacy empowers individuals to navigate the complex media landscape, discerning credible information from misinformation or manipulation. A cornerstone of media literacy is the use of multiple sources to verify facts. By comparing information from various reputable outlets, consumers can identify patterns, inconsistencies, or biases. Evaluating the credibility of sources is also essential. This includes considering the reputation Page 78 of 125 9. Digital Communication, Social Media, Misinformation and Democracy"}

Traditional methods also involve checking for objectivity, transparency about funding or affiliations, and whether the information is current and relevant. Determining whether information is factual or opinion-based requires careful analysis. Facts are statements that can be objectively verified with evidence, while opinions reflect personal beliefs or interpretations. Facts are often presented with quantifiable data without qualification with an intent to inform. Whereas opinions are often subjectively presented with adjectives and adverbs intended to persuade, or in some other way elicit an emotional response. A simple way to consider whether some content is more fact-based or opinion-based is to simply count the parts of speech. If the piece has notably more numerals, nouns, and verbs (objective) than it has adjectives and adverbs (subjective) then the piece may be more fact-based than opinion-based. But if the piece has more subjective language than objective language, you already know that the piece is more opinion than fact. Content creators bear the responsibility of producing accurate, transparent, and ethical media if they are, in fact, acting in an ethical framework. This means clearly distinguishing between facts and opinions, disclosing conflicts of interest, and correcting errors promptly. Creators should also be mindful of the potential impact of their messages on audiences, striving to avoid harm and promote informed understanding. Content consumers, on the other hand, must approach media with a critical mindset. This includes questioning the motives behind messages, recognizing bias, and seeking out diverse perspectives. Consumers should also engage in reflection about how media influences their thoughts and behaviors, and take action – such as sharing reliable information or educating others – to contribute positively to public discourse. By embracing these practices, both creators and consumers can foster a media environment that supports truth, accountability, and informed civic participation.

Artificial Intelligence (AI), Automation and Robotics, and Algorithmic Ethics Levels of AI; AI Moral Agency; Autonomous Vehicles; Chatbots; Robotics and Robot Ethics; Algorithmic Bias; Automation; Predictive Policing The story of automation is one of both disruption and transformation, shaping the very fabric of society from the earliest days of agriculture to the dawn of the Information Age. In the agricultural era, simple tools and animal-driven machines revolutionized food production, freeing human labor for other pursuits. The Industrial Revolution brought mechanized factories and assembly lines, dramatically increasing productivity but also displacing traditional crafts and altering social structures. The advent of computers in the 20th century marked another, automating complex calculations and data management, and laying the groundwork for the digital revolution. Today, as we enter the era of artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and robotics, the Figure 15: Robot typing at computer. pace of change is accelerating at an unprecedented rate, touching every aspect of our economic, social, and personal lives. Technologies such as advanced AI, autonomous vehicles, chatbots, and robotics are no longer confined to research labs or science fiction – they are rapidly becoming integral to how we work, communicate, and make decisions. AI systems now perform tasks ranging from diagnosing medical conditions to driving cars and moderating online content. Automation is transforming industries, from manufacturing and logistics to finance and customer service, while algorithmic decision-making increasingly shapes everything from hiring practices to law enforcement through predictive policing. This growing ubiquity brings both promise and peril: while these technologies offer the potential for greater efficiency, safety, and convenience, they also raise profound ethical questions about bias, accountability, and the distribution of power and opportunity. As these innovations continue to evolve, we must grapple with the sustainability of our current economic and social systems. Will the continued rise of AI, automation, and robotics lead to widespread job displacement, deepen existing inequalities, or erode human agency?

Levels of AI Artificial Intelligence (AI) exists along a spectrum of complexity and capability, often described in terms of “levels.” Early AI systems, such as expert systems, were designed to mimic the decision- making abilities of human specialists within narrow domains – think medical diagnosis or troubleshooting technical issues. These systems rely on predefined rules and logic, and while they can outperform humans in specific, well-defined tasks, they lack the flexibility and adaptability of broader intelligence. At the other end of the spectrum is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a theoretical form of AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human- like level. Beyond AGI lies Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), which would surpass human intelligence in virtually every field, including creativity, problem-solving, and social intelligence. Most of what is marketed as “AI” today – such as large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP) systems – falls far short of AGI or ASI. These models, including popular chatbots and content generators, are trained on vast, curated datasets but do not actively or continuously learn from new data once deployed. Instead, they are periodically “tuned” by their creators, often for specific domains or applications, which can introduce or reinforce biases and inaccuracies present in the training data. The curated nature of these datasets means that AI outputs can reflect the perspectives, limitations, and prejudices of the data and those who select it, leading to algorithmic bias and fairness issues. Despite rapid advances, none of today’s mainstream AI systems possess the autonomy, adaptability, or self-awareness associated with AGI. The path to AGI – and, by extension, ASI – remains uncertain, but many experts believe that once AGI is achieved, an immediate, unavoidable and unstoppable transition to ASI will follow.

The assumption that AGI or ASI could be reliably “controlled” is widely regarded as hubristic, given the unpredictable nature and potential power of such systems. Compounding these concerns is the lack of universal ethical definitions or standards in the data used to train AI, making it impossible to predict what kind of “ethical center” an advanced AI might develop. As a result, society faces urgent questions about how to guide the development of increasingly capable AI systems in ways that align with shared values and long-term human interests.

These systems currently lack consciousness, intentionality, and the capacity for ethical judgment, so moral agency and culpability remain with the humans who design, deploy, and use them. Developers are responsible for building systems that are safe and fair, operators must ensure proper oversight, and users must understand the tool’s limitations and risks. Attributing moral agency to these tools can lead to confusion, misplaced accountability, and the dangerous illusion that ethical responsibility can be delegated to technology. The conversation shifts dramatically when considering the hypothetical emergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). If an AI system were to achieve human-level understanding, autonomy, and the ability to make independent decisions (which a number of AI researchers and companies are actively pursuing), the question of moral agency becomes more complex and contentious. Would such a system deserve to be treated as a moral agent, or even as a legal entity, responsible for its actions? This debate is reminiscent of the gradual transfer of moral agency from parent to child: children initially lack full moral responsibility, which is, instead, held by their parents or guardians. But as children develop autonomy and understanding, they gradually assume agency for their own actions. Similarly, if AGI or ASI were to demonstrate genuine autonomy and ethical reasoning, there could be a case for shifting some degree of responsibility from the creators or users to the AI itself. However, this transition would be fraught with uncertainty, as we currently lack clear ethical rubrics, legal frameworks, or even a consensus on what would constitute an “ethical center” for such entities. Autonomous Vehicles Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly transforming transportation, with trucking and freight leading the way in the adoption of high-level autonomy.

Internationally, China’s Inceptio Technology and Germany’s on-road trials are pushing the envelope in large-scale autonomous truck deployment. These trucks promise to address driver shortages, increase operational efficiency, and reduce costs, with the potential to revolutionize logistics and supply chains globally. One of the most compelling arguments for autonomous vehicles is their potential to dramatically reduce vehicular crashes. Human error is responsible for over 90% of traffic accidents; by removing fatigue, distraction, and impaired driving from the equation, AVs could save thousands of lives annually. However, the transition is not without challenges. Legal and ethical questions loom large: when an autonomous vehicle is involved in a crash, who is responsible – the manufacturer, the software developer, the fleet operator, or the owner? Current legal frameworks are struggling to keep pace, and there is ongoing debate about how to assign liability and ensure accountability as vehicles become more autonomous. These questions will only grow in importance as AV technology becomes more ubiquitous, raising fundamental issues about trust, transparency, and the future of transportation. Chatbots Chatbots have evolved dramatically from their origins as simple, rule-based programs designed for entertainment or to answer basic questions. Early chatbots, like ELIZA in the 1960s, relied on scripted responses and could only handle straightforward, predictable interactions. As technology advanced, chatbots became popular in business settings for providing 24/7 customer service, automating frequently asked questions, and reducing the workload for human agents. The introduction of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) allowed chatbots to better understand context and intent, leading to more sophisticated conversational agents that could manage more complex queries. Today, chatbots are widely used not only for customer service but also for telemarketing, sales, and customer engagement, often serving as the first point of contact between companies and their customers.

These questions highlight the ethical complexities that accompany the rapid integration of chatbots into business and society, underscoring the need for thoughtful oversight and responsible development as the technology continues to advance. Robotics and Robot Ethics Robotics is the interdisciplinary field of engineering and computer science focused on the design, construction, operation, and use of programmable machines – robots – that can replicate, substitute, or assist human actions in various tasks. Some of the earliest robots were ancient automata, such as mechanical birds in ancient Greece and water clocks in China, but the modern concept of the robot emerged in the 20th century with inventions like George Devol’s Unimate, the first industrial robotic arm, which began operating at a General Motors facility in 1959. The field of robotics was further defined by Isaac Asimov’s introduction of the “Three Laws of Robotics,” which have influenced ethical thinking about robots ever since. Asimov’s three laws of robotics were defined as follows: Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics are: Page 95 of 125 11. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Automation and Robotics, and Algorithmic Ethics"}

A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. Although begun as a work of science fiction, these three laws have become a foundational starting- point for very many philosophical and ethical positions regarding how robotics should be ethically developed and utilized. Most industrial robots today are fully programmed using programmable logic controllers (PLCs) or computer numerical control (CNC) systems, enabling them to perform repetitive tasks such as welding, assembly, and painting within tightly controlled environments. These robots are typically limited to their pre-programmed domains and cannot adapt to new tasks without human intervention or reprogramming. However, advances in robotics have produced machines capable of operating in more diverse and less structured environments, such as autonomous mobile robots, manufacturing and warehouse automation systems, and even robots that can assist in surgery or explore hazardous locations. These more advanced robots use sensors, AI, and machine learning to make decisions and adapt to changing conditions, reducing the need for direct human oversight and expanding the potential applications of robotics. Some ethical questions raised by the increasing use of robotics include: • What are the societal consequences of job displacement caused by robotics without corresponding changes in the existing economic model? • Should robots be used for police or military operations, and what are the risks of delegating lethal force to machines? • Is it ethical to use robots to administer medicines or perform medical procedures, and who is responsible if something goes wrong? • Should robots be permitted to manufacture or design other robots, potentially accelerating automation and reducing human oversight? • How do we ensure safety and accountability when robots operate in public or shared spaces? • What rights, if any, should humans have to intervene in or override robot"}

These questions highlight the complex ethical landscape that accompanies the rapid advancement and integration of robotics into society. Algorithmic Bias Algorithmic bias arises because AI systems are fundamentally shaped by the data used to train them, the domains they are intended to operate within, and the objectives set by their developers. Most AI is trained on curated datasets that reflect the perspectives, limitations, and sometimes the prejudices of those who collect and label the data. These models are typically fixed within a specific domain, meaning their understanding and decision-making are limited to the patterns present in their training environment. Furthermore, the intended outcomes – what the AI is supposed to optimize or predict – are defined in advance by the tool’s creators, embedding their assumptions and priorities into the system. This results in inherent biases, which can become self-perpetuating as the AI consistently produces outputs that reinforce the patterns and disparities present in its training data. Imagine a hypothetical, national healthcare system that adopts an AI-powered tool to help prioritize patients for specialist referrals. The model is trained on historical data from urban hospitals, where access to care and patient demographics differ significantly from rural areas. Because the data underrepresents rural patients and overrepresents certain ethnic groups, the AI learns to prioritize urban, majority-population patients for referrals. Over time, this bias is amplified: rural and minority patients are systematically deprioritized, leading to poorer health outcomes and widening existing disparities. The system’s recommendations are trusted as “objective” because they come from an advanced AI, making it difficult for affected groups to challenge the results or for administrators to recognize the underlying bias.

If machine learning environments begin to “learn on their own” – continuously updating their models based on new data – the risk of algorithmic bias may become even more pronounced. Without explicit mechanisms to recognize and correct for bias, an AI could reinforce and amplify prejudices present in both its initial and ongoing data streams. How would such a system recognize that its data is incomplete or skewed? Could it ever truly understand the social and ethical context behind the data it consumes? Would it be able to distinguish between correlation and causation, or between majority patterns and minority needs?

These questions highlight the risk that algorithmic bias may be inevitable unless there is continuous human oversight, robust auditing, and deliberate efforts to diversify and scrutinize training data. But how will this be accomplished if the creators of the AI systems are allowed to claim ‘trade secrets’ or ‘national security’ and then withhold this information? As AI systems become more autonomous, the challenge of ensuring fairness and ethical outcomes will only grow more complex – demanding vigilance, innovation, and a commitment to equity at every stage of development and deployment. Automation Automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks without human intervention, marking a fundamental shift from humans merely using tools to tools independently executing work. The earliest automation can be traced back to inventions like water mills and mechanical clocks, which reduced the need for constant human oversight. The Industrial Revolution accelerated this trend with machines such as the Jacquard loom and assembly line systems, which automated textile production and manufacturing processes. Over time, automation evolved from simple mechanical aids to sophisticated systems capable of performing complex, repetitive, or hazardous tasks with minimal human input. The primary drivers for automation include improving health and safety by removing humans from dangerous environments, surpassing human physical and cognitive limitations, increasing speed and productivity, reducing fatigue and stoppages, and enhancing accuracy and consistency. Automation also allows for 24/7 operation, minimizes waste, and ensures higher quality control, all of which contribute to significant cost savings and increased profits for businesses. While these benefits are often framed in terms of operational efficiency, flexibility, and safety, they are ultimately subordinate to economic motivations: the adoption of automation is primarily justified by its potential to reduce labor costs, increase output, and boost competitiveness in the marketplace. Today, automation extends far beyond manufacturing. In logistics, automated warehouses and self- driving delivery vehicles streamline supply chains.

Or, will we need to rethink how value, work, and livelihood are distributed in a world where machines do most of the work? Predictive Policing Before the existence of formal laws, societies were governed by shared ethical norms – unwritten rules about right and wrong that guided individual and collective behavior. Laws and legal systems only emerged after these societal ethics were violated, requiring a codification of values into enforceable rules to maintain order and address breaches. Policing, as a profession and practice, arose to uphold these laws, maintain social order, and protect the community through the prevention, detection, and investigation of crime. The role of policing has always been closely tied to ethics, as officers are entrusted with significant power and discretion, and their actions can profoundly affect life, liberty, and public trust. Policing, however, has not always been a force for good. Throughout history, the institution has been subject to abuse – ranging from corruption and discrimination to excessive use of force and the protection of political interests over public welfare. These abuses highlight the ongoing tension between the ideals of ethical policing – courage, respect, empathy, and public service – and the realities of institutional culture and unchecked discretionary power. The evolution of policing models, from crime control to social peacekeeping, reflects an ongoing struggle to balance authority, accountability, and the ethical imperative to serve the public fairly and justly. Predictive policing is a recent development that uses algorithms and data analysis to forecast where crimes are likely to occur or who might be involved, with the aim of deploying resources more efficiently and preventing crime before it happens. Proponents argue that predictive policing can improve efficiency, reduce crime rates, and help allocate police resources more effectively. However, critics warn that these systems can amplify existing biases, lack transparency, and lead to over-policing of already marginalized communities. The risks of algorithmic bias, lack of oversight, and ethical ambiguity – discussed in previous sections – are especially acute in predictive policing, where flawed data"}

As predictive policing becomes more prevalent, the amplification of these risks could manifest in widespread surveillance, unfair targeting, and diminished civil liberties. Without rigorous ethical standards, transparency, and accountability, predictive policing could undermine the very societal values and ethical foundations that laws and policing were meant to protect.

Bioethics and Human Enhancement Genetic Engineering and CRISPR; Human Augmentations; Neuroethics and Brain- Computer Interfaces; Biotechnology; Cloning From the earliest days of recorded history, humans have striven to overcome injury, disease, and the limitations imposed by nature. Ancient civilizations developed rudimentary forms of medicine, using herbal remedies, ritualistic healing, and early surgical techniques to treat wounds and illnesses. Over centuries, the figure of the healer evolved into the professional doctor, as societies formalized the study of anatomy, pharmacology, and hygiene. The establishment of medical institutions and the codification of ethical standards, such as the original Hippocratic Oath as well as the current versions as it has evolved over the years, marked significant milestones in the professionalization of medicine. These advancements, coupled with improvements in sanitation, nutrition, and public health, contributed to dramatic increases in birth rates and steadily rising life expectancies across much of the world. In the modern era, the fusion of medicine and technology has ushered in a new age of diagnostics and treatment. Innovations such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), robotic-assisted surgery, gene sequencing, and targeted therapies have become accessible – and even commonplace – in many developed regions. These breakthroughs have enabled earlier detection of disease, more precise interventions, and improved outcomes for patients. Technologies like wearable health monitors, telemedicine platforms, and personalized medicine are reshaping the patient experience, making healthcare more efficient and, in some cases, more equitable. Yet, these advances are not uniformly distributed, and significant disparities in access to care persist both within and between nations. Today, the frontier of technology and human biology is rapidly expanding beyond traditional treatment. Emerging capabilities in genetic engineering allow for the possibility of designing offspring with selected traits, raising profound ethical questions about autonomy, consent, and the very definition of humanity.

Early agriculturalists learned to cultivate plants and animals with desirable traits – such as higher yields, resistance to disease, or improved taste – by intentionally mating individuals that exhibited these characteristics. Hybridization, the crossing of different species or varieties, produced vigorous new crops like hybrid grains and apples, while grafting and cloning techniques allowed for the propagation of seedless fruits such as bananas and larger, juicier varieties of produce. The transformation of wild teosinte (a Mexican grass) into modern maize (corn) is a striking example of how traditional breeding practices could fundamentally alter a species over generations. Similarly, the development of hybrid corn in the early 20th century revolutionized agriculture by increasing crop productivity. As scientific understanding deepened, especially following the discovery of DNA’s structure, genetic manipulation became more precise. By the mid-20th century, plant breeders were using radiation and chemicals to induce random mutations, further expanding the genetic toolkit available for crop improvement. The real turning point came in the 1970s, when researchers developed techniques to directly modify DNA – splicing genes from one organism into another, regardless of species boundaries. Early successes included the creation of recombinant bacteria and the first genetically modified plants, such as tobacco engineered for antibiotic resistance. In animals, transgenic mice paved the way for more complex genetic research and applications. The mapping of the human genome at the turn of the 21st century marked a watershed moment, providing a comprehensive blueprint of human genetic information. This achievement set the stage for the development of CRISPR, a revolutionary gene-editing technology that allows scientists to precisely \"cut and paste\" sections of DNA within living organisms. Today, CRISPR is being used in a wide range of applications – from developing disease-resistant crops and livestock to exploring potential cures for genetic disorders in humans.

Legal and ethical frameworks have struggled to keep pace with these rapid advancements. In the United States, it was once legal to patent isolated human genes, a practice that sparked significant controversy over ownership and access to genetic information. However, a 2013 Supreme Court decision ruled that naturally occurring human genes could not be patented, though synthetic DNA (cDNA) remains patentable. The legal landscape for genetic engineering in plants, animals, and humans remains ambiguous, with regulations varying widely by country and often lagging behind technological capabilities. This uncertainty raises pressing questions about equity, access, and the responsible use of genetic technologies as society moves deeper into the era of bioengineering. Human Augmentations Throughout history, humans have sought ways to restore lost function and even enhance their bodies, as evidenced by archaeological discoveries of ancient prosthetics and artificial enhancements.

In China, a 2,200-year-old man of modest means was discovered having a prosthetic leg made from poplar wood, ox horn, and horse hoof.

These early prosthetics were primarily functional, aiming to restore lost mobility or utility. However, some may have also served as markers of status, identity, or resilience, particularly when crafted with care or adorned with valuable materials. Over centuries, the evolution of prosthetic technology has mirrored advances in materials science, medicine, and engineering – from wood and metal devices fastened with leather straps to today’s lightweight carbon fiber limbs and sophisticated bionic prosthetics that can be controlled by neural signals. Modern human augmentation has moved beyond mere replacement of lost function. Today’s prosthetics can not only restore, but also enhance, physical abilities – sometimes surpassing what is considered “normal” human performance. Athletes with advanced running blades, for example, challenge conventional definitions of ability and fairness. Neural implants, exoskeletons, and sensory enhancements are pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human, raising profound questions about identity, equity, and the future of human evolution. Consider these ethical questions surrounding the topic of human augmentation: • Should there be limits on augmentations that enhance abilities beyond the typical human range, such as strength, speed, or cognition? • Who should have access to advanced augmentations – should they be available to all, or only to those who can afford them? • Could widespread augmentation create new forms of inequality or discrimination between “augmented” and “non-augmented” individuals? • How should society regulate the use of neural implants or brain-computer interfaces that could alter thought, memory, or personality? • If a person replaces most or all of their biological body with artificial parts, are they still the same person – philosophically or legally? • Should children be allowed or required to receive certain augmentations to compete or participate in society? • What responsibilities do designers and manufacturers have if an augmentation malfunctions or is hacked? • How might human augmentation affect the value society places on natural abilities or disabilities?

This last set of questions echoes the ancient philosophical thought experiment known as the Ship of Theseus: if every board of a ship is replaced over time, is it still the same ship? Applied to human augmentation, if all parts of a person are gradually replaced with artificial components, does their identity persist – or does something fundamentally change? This debate sits at the heart of the ethical, legal, and existential challenges posed by the future of human enhancement. Neuroethics and Brain-Computer Interfaces Neuroethics and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represent one of the most rapidly evolving frontiers in both neuroscience and technology. At the core of this field are neurological sensors, which can be broadly categorized as active or passive. Active sensors, such as deep brain stimulators and implanted electrodes, not only record neural activity but can also deliver electrical stimulation to targeted brain regions. Passive sensors, including electroencephalography (EEG) caps and functional MRI (fMRI), non-invasively monitor the brain’s electrical or metabolic activity for diagnostic and research purposes. These technologies have become invaluable in understanding neurological disorders, mapping brain Figure 16: Exaggeration of brain- function, and developing treatments for conditions such as computer-interface epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and severe paralysis. Brain-computer interfaces leverage these advances to create direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices. The most promising use cases include restoring movement or communication for individuals with paralysis, enabling control of prosthetic limbs, and providing new ways for people with severe disabilities to interact with the world. BCIs are also being explored for cognitive enhancement, mental health interventions, and even immersive gaming experiences. The ability to decode neural signals and translate them into digital commands holds transformative potential for medicine, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction.

This phenomenon mirrors broader concerns previously discussed in the chapter on Privacy, Surveillance, and Data Ethics. In that chapter we discussed how ‘big data’, the aggregation and analysis of massive datasets, can inadvertently expose sensitive personal information, create privacy risks, and lead to unintended uses of data. Just like with big data, the capture, storage, and analysis of neurological data repeats the same ethical concerns which include informed consent, data ownership, potential misuse of neural data, and the risk of surveillance or discrimination based on brain activity patterns. Neuralink, a leading company in the BCI space, has recently achieved a major milestone by successfully implanting its “Telepathy” device in a human subject. This coin-sized implant uses ultra- fine threads equipped with thousands of electrodes to record neural activity at a high resolution. The device has demonstrated the ability to detect neuron spikes and correlate brain signals with intended motor actions, allowing users to control computers or external devices directly through thought. Neuralink’s approach combines advanced neurosurgical robotics for precise implantation with custom electronics that process and transmit neural data. Neuralink is currently engaged in human trials, offering hope for individuals with severe neurological conditions and opening new possibilities for human-computer integration. Here, again, are several ethical questions surrounding neuroethics and BCIs: • To what extent could brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) be used to read or decode private thoughts and memories, and what safeguards should be in place to protect mental privacy? • If a BCI could send signals to the brain that override or contradict a person’s intended actions (such as controlling movement or behavior), who is responsible for the outcome, and how should consent be managed? • What ethical concerns arise if technology advances to the point where data can be written to the brain – potentially altering memories, perceptions, or even personality traits – rather than just reading from it? • How can"}

As BCI technology advances, the ethical landscape will require ongoing scrutiny, balancing the immense potential for benefit with the need to protect individual rights and societal values. Biotechnology Biotechnology is a broad field that encompasses the use of living organisms, cells, and biological systems to develop products and processes that benefit society. Many of the topics previously discussed – such as genetic engineering, CRISPR, brain-computer interfaces, and bioethics – are all integral parts of the biotechnology landscape. However, the reach of biotechnology extends even further, touching on a range of emerging technologies and applications that are reshaping medicine, agriculture, industry, and environmental management. Beyond gene editing and medical diagnostics, biotechnology now includes advanced innovations like nanotechnology for direct cell repair and targeted cancer therapies. Nanotech-enabled particles can be engineered to seek out and destroy cancer cells without harming healthy tissue, offering more precise and less invasive treatments. In addition, biotechnology has enabled the development of bioengineered organisms – microbes or plants designed to clean up pollution through processes like bioremediation and phytoremediation. These organisms can break down toxic substances in soil and water, helping to restore contaminated environments and improve public health. Another rapidly growing area is the production of bio-printed or lab-grown food. Using 3D printing technology and cell culture techniques, scientists can now create meat, organs, and other tissues in the lab, potentially reducing the environmental impact of traditional agriculture and providing new sources of nutrition. This technology is also being explored for medical applications, such as printing skin, bone, or even entire organs for transplantation. While the benefits of biotechnology are substantial, significant risks and uncertainties remain. One major concern is the possibility of unintended release of engineered organisms or nanotech agents into the environment.

Once released, these entities may not be easily converted from active to dormant or inert states, raising fears about long-term ecological impacts or the creation of new, hard-to-control forms of pollution. The microscopic or nanoscale nature of many biotech interventions also makes transparency and oversight difficult, complicating efforts to monitor their behavior and effects. For example, bioengineered microbes used to clean up oil spills or toxic waste could themselves become hazardous if they mutate or interact with other organisms in unexpected ways. While the pros of such applications include cleaner water and soil, the cons may involve the organisms becoming toxic Page 110 of 125 12. Bioethics and Human Enhancement"}

Similarly, lab-grown foods promise sustainability and food security, but raise questions about safety, labeling, and the social and economic impacts on traditional farming communities. Biotechnology is revolutionizing how we approach health, food, and environmental challenges, but it also demands careful consideration of the risks, especially regarding safety, transparency, and long- term sustainability. As these technologies become more integrated into daily life, ongoing ethical, legal, and societal debates will be essential to ensure they are used responsibly and equitably. Cloning Cloning, as a concept, has long fascinated humanity, appearing in ancient myths, literature, and modern entertainment as the idea of creating identical copies of organisms. The scientific journey toward cloning began in the late 19th century, when researchers like Hans Driesch demonstrated artificial embryo twinning in sea urchins, showing that separated embryonic cells could each develop into whole organisms. In the 20th century, landmark experiments included the cloning of frogs by nuclear transfer in the 1950s and the cloning of mammals from embryonic and adult cells in the 1980s and 1990s. The most famous breakthrough came in 1996 with the birth of Dolly the sheep, the first mammal cloned from an adult somatic cell, announced by Ian Wilmut and his team at the Roslin Institute in Scotland. Dolly’s creation proved that specialized adult cells could be reprogrammed to create an entire organism, igniting both scientific excitement and ethical debate. Other notable milestones include the cloning of cows, cats, and even monkeys, as well as the cloning of animals for agriculture, research, and pet reproduction. Attempts at human cloning have been more controversial and less successful. In 2001, scientists at Advanced Cell Technology in Massachusetts cloned human embryos for the first time, aiming for therapeutic rather than reproductive purposes. In 2013, a team led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov achieved a breakthrough in human cloning by creating embryonic stem cells from cloned human embryos.

News of human cloning efforts has generally been met with skepticism and concern within the scientific and medical communities, and has sparked strong opposition from religious, ethical, and political groups around the world. Reactions have ranged from moral outrage and calls for bans to cautious support for therapeutic cloning aimed at treating disease. Currently, human reproductive cloning is illegal or heavily restricted in the United States and many other countries. Therapeutic cloning – using cloned embryos to derive stem cells for research or medical treatment – remains a gray area, with regulations varying by state and ongoing debates about its ethical and legal status. The technology continues to raise profound questions about identity, individuality, and the boundaries of human intervention in nature. Page 111 of 125 12. Bioethics and Human Enhancement"}

Technological Disruption and the Paradox of Progress Obsolescence – Planned vs. Inevitable; Tech Lock-In and 3D Printing; AR/VR & Tech Progress; Erosion of Economic Sustainability Throughout history, the greatest leaps forward in human civilization have often been catalyzed by technological disruption. From the invention of the printing press, which democratized knowledge and upended centuries-old power structures, to the assembly line that revolutionized manufacturing and made goods accessible to millions, each wave of innovation has brought both profound progress and significant upheaval. These disruptions are rarely met with universal enthusiasm; while some individuals and industries embrace, adopt, and expand upon new technologies, others resist, fearing loss of livelihood, status, or control. The introduction of the personal computer, for example, was welcomed by early adopters and visionaries but met skepticism by those invested in mainframe computing or manual record keeping. Similarly, the rapid rise of the Internet in the 1990s transformed everything from commerce to communication, sparking both excitement and anxiety about its societal implications. Looking back at the past 50 to 75 years, many of the most notable disruptions align with the topics explored in earlier chapters. The digital revolution – driven by personal computers, the Internet, and later, mobile devices – has fundamentally altered how we work, learn, and connect. Advances in genetics and biotechnology, such as the mapping of the human genome and the development of CRISPR, have opened new frontiers in medicine and ethics. The rise of artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics has transformed industries, from manufacturing to healthcare, while also raising concerns about job displacement and algorithmic bias. In recent years, technologies like 3D printing, spatial computing, and wearable and embedded devices have further blurred the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds, creating new opportunities and challenges.

The paradox of progress is that while technological disruption drives unprecedented advancement, it also brings new challenges – planned and inevitable obsolescence, tech lock-in, erosion of economic participation, and environmental consequences – that demand thoughtful navigation in the decades ahead. Obsolescence – Planned vs. Inevitable The story of technological progress is often told through the lens of obsolescence, where each new leap forward renders a previous standard obsolete: the abacus gave way to the calculator, which was then eclipsed by the computer; buggy-whips disappeared as automobiles replaced horse-drawn carriages, soon followed by windshield wipers as standard equipment; the telegraph was overtaken by telephones, which themselves have been transformed by digital and VoIP communication; vinyl records yielded to cassette tapes, then CDs, and now streaming audio; and film cameras faded as digital photography became the norm. Each of these transitions highlights how new technologies not only replace old ones but also reshape industries, economies, and daily life. Inevitable obsolescence is a natural byproduct of technological disruption, as newer, better, or more efficient solutions emerge and make older versions less useful or even unserviceable. This cycle is accelerating, with product and component life cycles growing shorter as innovation speeds up and consumer expectations rise. The ethical implications of this relentless churn are complex. While much attention is paid to job displacement and the need to support those affected by disruption, a deeper question arises: should our ethical frameworks focus solely on preserving the status quo, or should they also empower us to reimagine the very structure of work, value, and participation in society?

In response to the threat of inevitable obsolescence, some businesses have adopted the strategy of planned obsolescence – intentionally designing products with limited lifespans or incremental improvements to encourage repeated purchases and maintain brand relevance. This approach allows companies to attempt to control the pace of change and manage consumer expectations, but it also raises ethical concerns about waste, resource use, and consumer manipulation. Ultimately, the interplay between inevitable and planned obsolescence shapes not only the technology landscape but also the broader social and ethical context in which innovation unfolds. Tech Lock-In and 3D Printing As a facet of planned obsolescence, many companies have increasingly adopted the practice of tech lock-in – designing products and systems that require vendor-specific components, consumables, or software, and sometimes even restricting or disabling functionality to ensure ongoing customer dependence. Classic examples include printer manufacturers requiring proprietary ink cartridges, smartphone ecosystems that only accept certified accessories, and enterprise software platforms that limit interoperability or export options. In the digital realm, cloud-based services and software-as-a- service (SaaS) solutions often lock users into proprietary file formats, APIs, or user experiences, making it difficult and costly to migrate to alternative providers. Major vendors like Apple, Salesforce, and Amazon Web Services are well-known for creating tightly integrated ecosystems that discourage switching by making data migration complex, costly, or incomplete. These strategies are further reinforced by contractual constraints, such as multi-year commitments, tiered pricing, and auto- renewals, which add financial friction to any potential move. This lock-in effect is exacerbated by the concepts of sunk costs and high conversion costs. Organizations and individuals invest significant time, money, and training into a particular platform or ecosystem, making the prospect of switching even more daunting. The more customized and integrated a solution becomes, the harder it is to leave – creating a cycle where users tolerate limitations or incremental upgrades rather than face the disruption and expense of change.

As a result, tech lock-in not only prolongs the viability of existing brands and products but also shapes the pace and direction of technological progress. But this tech lock-in also results in diminished innovation, and often a resignation to accepting inferior products due to lack of reasonable options. Page 120 of 125 13.

Since its inception in the 1980s, 3D printing has rapidly evolved from a prototyping tool to a transformative manufacturing technology. Today, it encompasses everything from nano-scale components to large-scale construction, including the printing of custom medical implants, automotive parts, aerospace components, and even entire homes. The technology’s versatility is evident in applications such as on-demand spare parts, personalized prosthetics, bio-printed tissues, and rapid prototyping for innovation across industries. Figure 17: 3D Printer creating prosthetic If the full potential of 3D printing were unleashed, it could disrupt several major status quos: • Traditional manufacturing and supply chains could be decentralized, with goods produced locally or even at home, reducing the need for mass production and global shipping. • Proprietary replacement parts and consumables could be bypassed, undermining tech lock-in strategies and empowering consumers to repair or modify products independently. • The barriers to entry for new inventors and small businesses would be dramatically lowered, fostering innovation and competition. • Entire industries, from construction to healthcare, could be transformed by the ability to produce complex, customized items on demand. • Environmental impacts could be mitigated by reducing waste, transportation emissions, and excess inventory. Ultimately, widespread adoption of 3D printing has the potential to challenge both the economic and ethical foundations of planned obsolescence and tech lock-in, shifting power from centralized producers to distributed creators and consumers.

By the late 1960s, the first head-mounted display, “The Sword of Damocles,” laid the groundwork for both virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), offering users computer-generated graphics that blended with or replaced their sensory experience of the real world. Over the decades, milestones such as flight simulators, interactive “artificial reality” labs, and data gloves paved the way for today’s spatial computing – where AR and VR converge to create interactive, immersive environments that respond to users in real time. Today, AR and VR technologies are transforming a wide range of industries. In entertainment, VR headsets and AR mobile games like Pokémon Go have redefined gaming and storytelling. Aerospace and automotive companies use VR for prototyping and immersive design, while AR assists with maintenance and training. In education, students explore historical sites or conduct virtual science experiments. The medical field employs VR for surgical training and pain management, and AR for overlaying critical information during procedures. Retailers offer virtual try-ons, architects visualize buildings at scale, and therapists use immersive simulations for mental health treatments. Even manufacturing and logistics benefit from AR overlays that guide workers or optimize warehouse operations. Looking ahead, the fusion of AR/VR with machine learning and other emerging technologies promises to disrupt even more status quos. Imagine: • Virtual prototyping of clothing or products, allowing users to “try before they print” with 3D printing. • Entire public spaces transformed through AR, offering personalized information, art, or advertising on demand. • Realistic VR/AR simulations for social skills training, therapy, or remote collaboration. • Educational experiences that adapt in real time to student performance, providing personalized learning paths. • Remote medical consultations using AR overlays to guide both patient and provider. • Urban planning tools that let communities visualize and interact with proposed changes before they happen. • Fully immersive remote workspaces, blurring the line"}

Embracing technological progress means not only harnessing these tools for innovation and growth, but also facing the ethical challenges they bring – ensuring that the future we build is both immersive and inclusive. Erosion of Economic Sustainability Earlier in this chapter, we looked at obsolescence and how it could be considered either inevitable or planned. Now let’s consider our current economic models, specifically their sustainability. The most prevalent model globally is capitalism, which is defined by private ownership of resources and means of production, with goods and services exchanged in markets driven by supply and demand. Another model is socialism, where the state or community owns the means of production and aims to distribute wealth more equally. There are also mixed economies, which blend elements of both systems to varying degrees. Each of these models has evolved to address the needs and challenges of their times, but all are fundamentally shaped by the dynamics of labor, consumption, and resource allocation. The accelerating rate of technological change, coupled with the disruptive nature of tech progress, poses significant challenges to the sustainability of these economic systems. Automation, artificial intelligence, and digital platforms are rapidly transforming industries, often rendering traditional jobs obsolete faster than new roles can be created. This disruption threatens the foundation of economic participation in models like capitalism, which rely on widespread employment and consumer spending to drive growth.

This disruption threatens the foundation of economic participation in models like capitalism, which rely on widespread employment and consumer spending to drive growth. To counteract these effects, societies have experimented with artificial supports such as subsidies, retraining programs, and universal basic income (UBI).

Instead, Maslow’s pyramid begins with physiological needs (food, water, shelter), followed by safety, belonging, esteem, and ultimately self-actualization. While money can help secure basic needs, research shows that happiness and fulfillment plateau once a certain level of financial security is achieved. If we imagine a world where technological advancements – automation, AI, biotechnology, and beyond – are harnessed intentionally to meet all of Maslow’s needs directly, the necessity for traditional economic systems would need to be fundamentally reevaluated. In such a scenario, access to food, shelter, healthcare, education, and even opportunities for personal growth could be decoupled from employment and income, challenging us to envision new models of economic and social organization that prioritize human well-being over perpetual economic growth.

This is an international standard that provides high-level guidance on the principles, roles, and responsibilities for effective IT governance. ISO/IEC 38500 helps organizations evaluate, direct, and monitor their use of IT to achieve their business objectives and fulfill their legal and ethical obligations. • ITIL. This is a widely adopted framework that focuses on the delivery and management of quality IT services that meet the needs and expectations of customers and stakeholders. ITIL covers the entire service lifecycle from strategy to design, transition, operation, and improvement. ITIL helps organizations improve their service efficiency, effectiveness, reliability, and value.

COBIT defines control as “the means of managing risk to ensure that enterprise objectives will be achieved” and assurance as “the provision of objective evidence that the design and operation of the system of internal control meets the agreed-upon requirements”. COBIT provides guidance on how to design, implement, monitor, evaluate and improve the system of internal control and assurance using the following processes: MEA01: Managed Performance and Conformance Monitoring. This process collects, validates, and evaluates enterprise and alignment goals and metrics, monitors that processes and practices are performing against agreed performance and conformance goals and metrics, provides systematic and timely reporting, and provides transparency of performance and conformance and drives achievement of goals."}

According to ISACA, humans represent a mystery to be deciphered by security/cybersecurity experts because their behaviours, attitudes, beliefs, rituals and decisions constitute a little-understood universe for executives and their heads of security. The human factor in information security can be seen as the weakest link in the chain or as the reliable and resilient factor of the system, depending on how organizations approach the challenge of educating and empowering their employees.

What is a data breach? A data breach occurs when personal information that an entity holds is subject to unauthorised access or disclosure or is lost. Personal information is information about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable. Entities should be aware that information that is not about an individual on its own can become personal information when it is combined with other information, if this combination results in an individual becoming ‘reasonably identifiable’ as a result.

It could be through transmission errors, by intentional manipulation, by unintentional handling errors or by the corruption of file content or structure due to electrical, magnetic or other failures. Consequences of a data breach Data breaches can cause harm in multiple ways. Individuals whose personal information is involved may be at risk of serious harm, whether that is harm to their physical or mental well-being, financial loss, or damage to their reputation.

As such, there is no single way of responding to a data breach. Each breach will need to be dealt with on a case-by- case basis, with an understanding of the risks posed by a breach and the actions that would be most effective in reducing or removing these risks.

The parts of this process that are required by the NDB scheme are coloured red. The NDB scheme is explained in detail in Part 4 of this guide. Step 1: Contain Once an entity has discovered or suspects that a data breach has occurred, it should immediately take action to limit the breach. For example, stop the unauthorised practice, recover the records, or shut down the system that was breached. If it is not practical to shut down the system, or if it would result in loss of evidence, then revoke or change computer access privileges or address weaknesses in physical or electronic security.

During this preliminary stage, be careful not to destroy evidence that may be valuable in identifying the cause of the breach, or that would enable the entity to address all risks posed to affected individuals or the entity. Step 2: Assess An assessment of the data breach can help an entity understand the risks posed by a data breach and how these risks can be addressed. It should be conducted as expeditiously as possible. Gather and evaluate as much information about the data breach as possible. By creating a complete picture of the data breach, an entity can ensure they understand the risk of harm to affected individuals and identify and take all appropriate steps to limit the impact of a data breach. This assessment should also assist entities in deciding whether affected individuals must be notified. In your assessment of a data breach, consider:"}

All entities should consider whether remedial action can be taken to reduce any potential harm to individuals. This might also take place during Step 1: Contain, such as by recovering lost information before it is accessed. Entities subject to the NDB scheme are required to assess ‘suspected’ eligible data breaches and take reasonable steps to complete this assessment within 30 days (see Assessing a suspected data breach). Criteria for assessing a data breach, including the risk of harm and remedial action, is explored in Identifying eligible data breaches. Step 3: Notify Notification can be an important mitigation strategy that has the potential to benefit both the entity and the individuals affected by a data breach. The challenge is to determine when notification is appropriate. Sometimes, notifying individuals can cause undue stress or harm. For example, notifying individuals about a data breach that poses very little or no risk of harm can cause unnecessary anxiety.

The definition of APP entity generally does not include small business operators, registered political parties, state or territory authorities, or a prescribed instrumentality of a state (s 6C). However, some businesses of any size are APP entities, including businesses that trade in personal information12 and organisations that provide a health service to, and hold health information about, individuals (see Is my organisation a health service provider?).

This means that acts and practices of APP entities that are exempt from the Privacy Act will also be exempt from the NDB scheme. For example, in some circumstances, private sector employers do not have to comply with the APPs in relation to employee records associated with current and former employment relationships (s 7B(3)). If an exempt employee record is subject to unauthorised access, disclosure or loss, the private sector employer does not have to assess the breach or notify individuals and the Commissioner. This exemption does not apply to TFN information that is contained within an employee record. However, given community expectations around the handling of their personal information, it is recommended that employers notify affected individuals where a breach of an employee record is likely to result in serious harm. Doing so will enable affected individuals to take protective action against any potential harms, as well as illustrating to employees that the security of their records is taken seriously.

To this end, it has produced (in conjunction with others a maturity model that allows organisations to proactively evaluate and improve their ability to manage cyber security incidents. It is intended for process improvement, it does not measure how well a given incident management activity is performed, only that it is performed. The rationale behind this approach is to allow individual organisations to devise their own implementation, having been given sufficient guidance to do so. These incident management capabilities have evolved over many years. They are based on a set of metrics developed by the US Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and National Security Agency (NSA) in 2000-2002. The Department of"}

The results from an assessment can help an organization determine the comprehensiveness of its incident management function. What We Mean by Incident Management Function (IMF) An incident management function is a set of capabilities (the people, processes, technology, etc. that provide an ability or capacity to perform some task) considered essential to protecting, detecting, and responding to incidents, as well as sustaining the incident management function (refer to Alberts and colleagues for more information [Alberts 2004]). These capabilities can be provided internally by security or network operators; be outsourced to managed security service providers (MSSPs); or be provided and managed by a computer security incident response team (CSIRT), security operations centre (SOC), or security team. We recognize that CSIRTs might not always be providing these capabilities."}

The term constituency is used to refer to those who receive the services provided by whoever is performing incident management activities. The term organization is used to refer to the entire group that is composed of the incident management personnel as well as their constituency. Occasionally we use the term CSIRT, which refers to a designated function or group of people to perform a portion of the incident management functions. Incident management capabilities are grouped into the five categories described in Table 1— Prepare, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Sustain.

Using These Capabilities to Assess the Incident Management Function of an Organization This section provides an overview of how the capabilities can be used to assess and improve an organization’s incident management function. This section and the next provide an overview of the assessment methodology and considerations for scoring the capabilities. To generalize, this assessment method centres around using interviews, artefact reviews, and activity observations to determine how completely the incident management activities represented in the capabilities are performed. It is possible to use these capabilities for a broad range of assessments. For example, the entire set of capabilities can be used to assess an organization’s entire incident management function. A subset can be used to focus on only the specific responsibilities of an actual SOC, CSIRT, or security service provider. The extent or scope of an assessment is determined early in the process, based on the goals of the organization or the specific focus of the assessment sponsor. The assumption for this section is that the entire incident management function is being assessed. An assessment with a narrower"}

Incident management, as a complete function, includes activities that may be performed within a SOC, by a CSIRT, or by other groups across an organization. There may be several groups, each with some distinct or overlapping responsibilities that support management of cybersecurity events and incidents. In the latter case, applying these capabilities against only a designated centralized incident management function or CSIRT may result in an inaccurate or very limited view of the organization’s total ability to effectively manage cybersecurity incidents. An assessment should consider all groups performing incident management activities to produce accurate results. An assessment using these capabilities generally requires: • Assessment planning: establishing points of contact, assessment scope, schedule, and resources and assembling the assessment team and supporting equipment and supplies • Pre-assessment: preparing for on-site assessment activities; gathering information as needed before going onsite; analysing available documents and other artifacts; identifying groups and individuals (e.g., groups involved in Prepare, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Sustain activities) to interview onsite; allocating capabilities to those groups; and finalizing the onsite schedule"}

Identify the Groups Involved in Incident Management and Allocate the Capabilities There are many techniques for identifying the groups involved in incident management. One technique uses a process model benchmark for incident management, such as that described by Alberts and colleagues (2004). By comparing the organization to this process model of incident management activities, all groups performing such activities can be identified. An alternative is to use some form of work process modelling to map all groups and interfaces associated with incident management activities. Once the groups and activities are identified, capabilities can then be allocated to each group"}

Bear in mind that there may not be clearly defined roles that align with the categories, and you may need to ask more than one group about the same set of capabilities to achieve complete coverage. While you can adjust your schedule of interviews and observations when onsite, it is best to keep schedule adjustments to a minimum. Assess Each Group The simplest means of assessing each group against its capabilities is to conduct interviews or group discussions, observe the activity being performed or a demonstration of the activity, and ask the assembled individuals about each capability that is applicable to their group. Artefacts related to the capabilities can be requested and reviewed and, when necessary, additional activities can be observed. The assessment team should use the general scoring guidance in Section 4 of the model and the specific guidance provided with each capability to guide its assessment. (See Section 2 of the model, “Explanation of the Capability Structure,” for a description of the sections and indicators provided for each capability.)

All indicators are scored as either Yes or No, and Capabilities are scored at the end as “Met,” “Not Met,” “Not Observed,” or “Not Applicable.” • “Met”—At a minimum, all the required indicators have been met. • “Not Met”—One or more of the required indicators has not been met. • “Not Observed”—A capability cannot be assessed because the assessment team does not have access to the individuals who can provide the correct answer or cannot observe that the activity or capability was performed. • “Not Applicable”—The activity is not included in the assessment, which may mean that it is deliberately not performed by the organization as part of the incident management processes.

Alternatively, those groups could assess themselves using applicable information from these capabilities and then provide the results (or feedback) to appropriate individuals. Another option is to use an external or third-party organization to perform the assessment on relevant groups. If part of the incident management function is outsourced and the organization being assessed can provide sufficient evidence to prove that the outsourced contractor or group is performing the capability, the outsourced contractor or group may not need to be assessed.

It knows what its strengths and weaknesses are. To improve the processes, the organization can look at the resulting scores and begin to create a strategy for improvement building on its strengths. For example, the candidates for improvement could be sorted by priority order, so that unmet Priority I capabilities come first, and so on. Existing strengths can be used to improve weaker areas. For example, if some capabilities have exceptionally good procedures and policies, use those as a basis for developing policies and procedures for capabilities that are not as robust or are missing. If there is a strong training program for some types of personnel, expand that program to include additional types of training for capabilities that are lacking. A further review of results may be needed when considering improvements in Priority II through Priority III capabilities. For example, improving a Priority III capability from “Not Met” to “Met” might be less critical than improving a Priority II capability from “Not Met” to “Met.” Each organization makes its own determination concerning the order in which to improve scores on any Priority II-III capabilities based on a review of the entire set and by considering the changes that are needed, the required resources, the mission, the goals, and the objectives.

This examination can provide elemental insight into whether improvement might yield an unexpected result.

Each capability can have a score of “Met” or “Not Met.” To determine the score for a capability, the assessment team applies the rules of evidence against all the information gathered from interviews, demonstrations, observations, and document or artefact reviews. Interviews are question-and- answer sessions with one or more people with peer relationships where the assessment team uses the capabilities as the basis for asking questions. In observations, the assessment team watches one or more people conduct their actual IM activities; the team observes only and does not question or ask for additional actions. In demonstrations, the assessment team interacts with the people performing real or hypothetical IM activities, asking questions, getting demonstrations of what could occur, or how tools might be used in hypothetical situations. Observations and interviews are similar. Document"}

For each capability, all Required indicators must have an answer of “Yes” to obtain a successful or passing score for that capability (i.e., the capability is met). If one or more of the Required indicators has an answer of “No,” the score for the capability is “Not Met.” The Recommended Best Practice indicators and the Institutional and Quality Improvement indicators include those that are not necessarily required to achieve success for the capability but are recommended. These indicators are not included in the final determination of a capability being met or not met. They are currently provided for improvement purposes. See Section 4.3 for alternative scoring ideas. Evidence Collection Requirements Sufficient evidence for establishing a passing score requires more than one document, interview, observation, or demonstration. The indicators listed with each capability are used to assist in the collection of evidence. The Evidence column to the right of each indicator is used to record the type of evidence (e.g., interview, observation, demonstration, or document review) or a description of the evidence that was used to score that indicator.

Determine Personnel Knowledge of Procedures and Successful Training The assessment team should be able to determine from discussions with the personnel whether they understand the process (e.g., they are able to describe it intelligently and consistently). More importantly, the personnel should be able to easily show how they perform that work (e.g., show the forms that they fill in, describe the process they use to take information from an incident report that is displayed and extract information to feed into summary or other organizational or regulatory reports, or demonstrate how they perform analysis on a set of logs).

During demonstrations, the assessment team can ask personnel to discuss the process they are following to show a level of understanding that supports knowledge of their capabilities about the activities being conducted. The observation of personnel performing tasks can also provide an indication of the maturity of their operations and training. For example, observation can show that personnel know the following: • how to use the tools that support the capabilities • where reports or data are archived • what types of information are contained in reports or alerts or other documents and products • where procedures, policy, or guidance documents are kept and how to access them if needed Scoring Variations It is possible for the assessment team and assessment sponsors to determine a different scoring algorithm (e.g., all the Required and Recommended Best Practice for a “Met” score)."}

In addition to the “Met,” “Not Met,” “Not Observed,” or “Not Applicable” scores for a capability, some assessors have used a “Partial” score. “Partial” in this case would mean that some of the Required indicators have been met, but not all. “Partial” scores can be difficult to use as it becomes more subjective as to what percentage or number of Required indicators is needed to reach a “Partial” as opposed to a “Not Met” score. Some assessment teams have also found it useful to use “Not Observed,” or “Not Applicable” for the indicators as well as the capability.

The plans that are developed will establish and sustain the incident management function in terms of how it will function, communicate, and deal with incidents when they occur. The core processes are needed to define how the various key activities will be carried out, and the essential tools needed by the incident management function must be acquired. Chief among these tools is the incident repository where all the information relevant to incidents will be retained. This repository allows not only the immediate analysis of current incidents but also later analysis for trends and patterns, forensic analysis, and so forth. Finally, no incident management function can be effective if it operates in isolation. IM personnel must establish trusted relationships with other experts to be aware of events and other types of attacks going on outside the organization and to reach back for additional expertise and help when faced with a new or unprecedented form of incident or the need for new tools.

The C2M2 is based on the SEI’s Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) framework, which is widely used in software engineering and other industries to assess and improve organizational processes. The basic concept of the ‘capability maturity models’ has been applied across various industries and professions owing to its simple conceptual design and adaptability. They simply establish the comprehensive range of processes that must be performed for given discipline, then measures how well a particular process is being performed. One of the advantages of the CMM (Capability Maturity Model) concept is that they are ‘process model’ that describes the process, but not how to execute the process, leaving that for the organisation to devise their own ways and means on the assumption that they know their business best. A ‘one size fits all’ model that prescribes the ‘how’ would not work in practice. With this flexibility of application, but encompassing all required activities, a maturity model becomes an excellent process improvement tool. The concept was originally devised in the 1980’s by Watts Humphrey at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. There was a need to establish the means for the US Dept of Defense to evaluate the software development capabilities of suppliers"}

And to provide those suppliers with the means to improve their capability. The key rationale behind the design of CMMs (Capability Maturity Model) can be summarized as follows: Assessing Current Capabilities – CMMs aim to provide a systematic and standardized way of evaluating an organization’s current capabilities in a specific area. By assessing their capabilities against predefined maturity levels, organizations can gain insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. This assessment helps organizations identify gaps and set realistic goals for enhancing their performance. Establishing a Common Language – CMMs create a common language and shared understanding within an organization and across industries. They define key concepts, processes, and practices related to a specific domain, enabling organizations to communicate and collaborate effectively. This common language facilitates knowledge sharing, benchmarking, and comparison among different organizations. Providing a Roadmap for Improvement – CMMs offer a structured roadmap for organizations to enhance their capabilities incrementally. By defining maturity levels and associated practices, CMMs provide organizations with a clear progression path. This roadmap allows organizations to prioritize and focus their efforts on areas that require"}

Encouraging Continuous Improvement – CMMs emphasize the importance of continuous improvement and ongoing development. They recognize that maturity is not a static state but rather a journey of constant growth and evolution. CMMs encourage organizations to adopt a culture of learning, innovation, and adaptation, fostering a mindset of continuous improvement in their practices, processes, and performance. Enabling Benchmarking and Best Practices – CMMs facilitate benchmarking against industry best practices and standards. They provide organizations with a reference point to compare their capabilities with peers and industry leaders. This benchmarking allows organizations to identify areas where they lag and learn from others’ successes. It promotes knowledge sharing and collaboration, ultimately driving overall industry advancement. Supporting Decision-Making and Resource Allocation – CMMs help organizations make informed decisions and allocate resources effectively. By providing a structured assessment of capabilities and areas for improvement, CMMs enable organizations to prioritize investments, allocate resources efficiently, and address critical gaps. This data-driven approach ensures that resources are allocated based on identified needs and strategic objectives. In summary, the design of capability maturity models is"}

CMMs serve as valuable tools for organizations to enhance their capabilities, establish industry best practices, and achieve higher levels of performance in a structured and systematic manner. 4.7 C2M2 Maturity Levels The C2M2 consists of five maturity levels, each with a set of capabilities that organizations must demonstrate to achieve that level. The five levels are: Initial (Level 1) At this stage, cybersecurity practices are ad hoc and unorganized. The organization has limited awareness of cybersecurity risks and lacks a formal strategy. There may be a reactive approach to security incidents, and the focus is primarily on resolving immediate issues rather than implementing preventive measures. The primary goal at this level is to establish a foundation for a structured cybersecurity program. Managed (Level 2) At the managed level, the organization starts implementing"}

There is a defined and documented cybersecurity policy and strategy. The organization has a better understanding of its critical assets and associated risks. Incident response plans and procedures are established, and regular vulnerability assessments are conducted. The focus at this level is on establishing a management framework for cybersecurity. Defined (Level 3) The defined level signifies a higher level of cybersecurity maturity. At this stage, the organization has a well-defined and documented set of cybersecurity processes and controls. Policies, procedures, and standards are in place and communicated throughout the organization. Risk management processes are established, and cybersecurity responsibilities are clearly defined. Security awareness training programs are conducted for employees, and regular audits and assessments are performed to ensure compliance.

Risk assessments are performed regularly, and security incidents are tracked and monitored using advanced tools and technologies. Continuous improvement is a key aspect at this level, with the organization using data-driven insights to enhance its cybersecurity capabilities. Optimized (Level 5) The optimized level represents the highest level of cybersecurity maturity. At this stage, the organization has a proactive and adaptive approach to cybersecurity. It continually monitors emerging threats and incorporates them into its security strategy. The organization actively participates in information sharing and collaboration with industry peers and government entities. It leverages advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to detect and respond to cyber threats in real-time. Regular testing, simulations, and exercises are conducted to ensure the effectiveness of cybersecurity controls and response plans."}

And not before. In this structured way, the Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model lays out a definitive roadmap for organizations to identify their current maturity level, to set goals for improvement, and continuously improve their cybersecurity capabilities. The assessment of an organization’s maturity level is typically conducted through an assessment of its existing cybersecurity practices, policies, procedures, and technical controls. This assessment involves interviews, documentation reviews, and technical assessments. The results are then mapped against the maturity levels defined in the model to determine the organization’s current level and identify areas for improvement. Evidence that processes are being performed is required when doing assessments. This structured approach to building a robust cybersecurity program brings alignment with industry best practices and regulatory requirements. Customers may be interested to know a potential supplier’s maturity level and might prescribe a minimum level as a condition of doing business and integrating the organisation into a supply chain."}

Organizations therefore use the C2M2 to consistently measure their cybersecurity capabilities over time, to identify target maturity levels based on risk, and to prioritize the actions and investments that allow them to meet their targets.

These theories offer different approaches to evaluating ethical questions. Understanding these ethical theories enables individuals to engage in informed ethical debates and make well-reasoned moral judgments. Each theory offers unique perspectives on how to address ethical dilemmas and make principled decisions. 5.1 How do we define ethics? Ethics is the general name for the branch of moral philosophy that deals with behaviour that increases people’s well-being. Ethics in the context of this book is therefore about how technologists should behave to increase people’s well-being. Ethics is not about religion or being slavishly law-abiding, nor is it about going along with the majority view held by the people around you. Ethics is having your own moral compass. Technology is ethical when it helps people reach their fullest potential; when it improves their quality of life, makes them happier and more fulfilled, and gives them the freedom to choose what they want to be. We consider the interests of people living here and now, but also the interests of future generations, other living creatures, and the preservation of the environment. Technology is unethical when it dehumanises; when it makes a person less human than they were. It forces people to engage in behaviour that diminishes them or the environment"}

Simply put, ethics is a guide to how to live well, how to be in the world in a way that creates benefit and minimises harm. Why do we need ethics? Ethics allows us to live in harmony and cooperation with others. When people are ethical, we can trust one another. We can build communities and organisations that can achieve outcomes that a single, self-interested individual would be incapable of. Without ethics, we would lack loyalty and be unable to trust others and form cooperative communities of interest. Long- term relationships would be difficult if not impossible. We could not have the economies that now exist in the developed world where wealth and a high standard of living are enjoyed by most. Life without ethics would likely be nasty, short, and brutish. Levels of ethics Ethics or right behaviour has three broad levels of application: Personal ethics guide how you live, what you do, and how you interact with others.

Organisational ethics is an aspect of organisational culture. It is how the organisation behaves and how it interacts with people. This level of ethics has explicit and implicit components. The explicit is clearly stated by management, written down and understood to be ‘correct’ behaviour. The implicit is not written down but is nonetheless understood to be the ‘way things are done’. As with personal ethics, this middle level should cultivate a sense of responsibility for how the organisation’s actions impact on the world. System ethics is concerned with how the overall economic and social systems behave, how it interacts with people. Ethics at the system level is codified into laws and codes of acceptable conduct; cultural practices that by consensus are widely understood and practices. As with the previous two levels, systems ethics cultivates a sense of responsibility for how the system impacts on the world in general. System ethics tries to create a system that best serves the interests of the greatest number of people. As a citizen, you have a right to vote and to have your voice heard.

If ethics is about behaviour, values are about what you believe to be important, and what you would like to see more of by means of more ethical behaviour. For example, in western-style democracies, values are codified into ‘rights’. Freedom of speech, freedom of religious worship, the pursuit of happiness and many other values are all considered to be our birth right as human beings. Values come before ethics. The ethical standards of a society will reflect these pre-existing values. Values come from many sources; one’s family, the media, religion, the community, one’s education and life experiences. Values change over time with the evolution of societies and culture. While it is true that much of our value system is created through our childhood experiences, they can nonetheless be changed through a process of conscious self- reflection and external influences.

Ethics in the context of this book is therefore about how technologists should behave to increase people’s well-being.

As you go about your work, you act in the interests of your employer so long as this does not conflict with your duty to the public interest. This means that you should not be developing technology that will adversely affect public health, public safety and the natural or built environment. You identify those who will be impacted by your work and actively consider their interests to avoid harming them. If you become aware of conflicts between your professional work and any legal or social factors, you work with the stakeholders to resolve the conflict before the problem becomes more serious. These can include problems the stakeholder(s) might have with what you are doing, or any conscientious objections you yourself might have.

The ethical technologist considers the impact that technology has on society and individuals and actively works to minimise the negative effects while maximising the positive. The ethical technologist cultivates an equity of access attitude that gives the under-privileged members of society the same access that the more privileged already have. As an ethical technologist, you develop an awareness of the many ways that ICT can enhance people’s quality of life, particularly those less advantaged people in society and the world generally (for example in the developing world). The technology you develop should promote the health and safety of the people who use it or are affected by it. At the very least it should not harm anyone. At a more abstract level, the use of technology should create a positive perception and a deeper sense of personal satisfaction in people. It should help people become a fuller expression of their human potential by allowing them to do what they were previously unable to do, and which gives them great satisfaction to do. This core ethical value is an extension of the Public Interest value discussed in the previous section."}

To dispel this fear, the ethical technologist takes a calm, objective and well-informed approach to their professional work. As an ethical technologist, you encourage other practitioners to behave in accordance with the code and do nothing to tarnish the image of the profession.

Appendix A is an example of how the EDM can be applied to an IT-related case study. The solutions in the example are indicative, not definitive. The model has three main stages: analysis, prioritisation, decision. Analysis is getting the facts and categorising them into extrinsic factors (legal, professional, employment, social, personal) and intrinsic (a person’s individual attributes). Prioritisation involves ranking the elements into order of importance by means of a priority table. A Decision is made by rationally weighing up the relative importance of the elements. No two people who approach a complex situation will perceive the various factors the same. Their perceptions are filtered through the lens of their personal experience and intrinsic leanings. The precise nature of what reaches their cognitive centre will be different for every person and might even differ for the same person on different occasions. Applying the defined process of the EDM helps to remove the subjectivity from the situation and gives us an objective, process-based approach to the solving of ethical dilemmas."}

Personal factors include those aspects of your make-up that psychologists categorise as coming from the ‘Nurture’ side of the ‘Nature-Nurture’ theory (of what makes us what we are). These are the factors that you acquire from the environment, your family, close friends and associates, your peer group, sporting association or faith community.

It is your set of innate qualities, the behavioural disposition with which you were born, the disposition that your genetic make-up has equipped you with. People are born with differing degrees of a wide variety of personality traits. These are summed up in The Big Five Personality Traits which are extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism. Each trait represents a continuum. Individuals fall anywhere on the continuum for each trait. For example, with the extraversion/ introversion continuum you can be anywhere on the bell curve from very extraverted to very introverted or somewhere in between. The Big Five remain relatively stable throughout most of one’s lifetime. So, people’s Nature can vary widely within the broad definition of being human.

While this is a potential problem, someone with the kind of personal and intrinsic attributes that makes them uncomfortable with what is generally accepted for an IT developer is unlikely to last long working in this capacity. Applying the analysis to an example. Consider the case of the market research company that collects demographic information from the broader community and sells contact lists to interested parties who want to do targeted direct marketing. The market research company obtains people’s informed consent to collect and store this information. But now the company changes hands and the new owner wants to increase profits. The owner instructs their web programmers to implement deceptive strategies aimed at gathering information for which they have no informed consent. This instruction contravenes privacy legislation, and the professional code of conduct. It is also contrary to community expectations on privacy.

While it is clearly wrong from a legal, professional, and social perspective, if an IT developer working there is intrinsically homophobic, their disposition will influence their thinking on whether it is right to supply the names. The developer may well perceive this as an ethical dilemma, when the developer sitting in the next cubicle clearly sees it as a wrong act. Step 2: Prioritisation Prioritisation is most easily performed by the making of a list that shows each factor in descending order of importance.

The format with the EDM is somewhat different, but the principle is the same. As a rule, the Legal and Professional factors take precedence since there is an obligation on everyone to abide by the law with no exceptions.

Within the legal framework that governs society we have the various professions, medicine, law, accounting for example. All professions have a Code of Professional Conduct. It is always incumbent upon members to know it and practice it. Membership of that profession is conditional on a sincere undertaking that as a member you will do your utmost to follow the code. Codes of Professional Conduct have relevance to professional standards legislation that exists in many jurisdictions. Breaches of the Code can be used as grounds for a claim of professional negligence. In legal proceedings, the Code can be quoted by an expert witness giving an assessment of professional conduct. The Australian Computer Society’s code of ethics can be summarised as follows; always act in the public interest, your work should enhance people’s quality of life, you should be honest, hard-working, competent and stay current with the latest developments, and finally do what you can to enhance the reputation of the profession. If a conflict occurs between these values, the deciding factor is what is in the public interest, otherwise known as the ‘greater good’. Codes of conduct of professional computer societies in"}

The way in which they are expressed may be outwardly different but the essential, underlying meaning will be similar. Codes of professional conduct and the larger laws of society are certain to be consistent with each other. For example, the first item in the ACS code clearly states that you should always act in accordance with the public interest, which by default is governed by law. Professional groups will never advocate behaviour that even hints at being unlawful or not consistent with the values of the society in which it operates. They want to establish a respectable place for themselves in society. Social factors will also be broadly consistent with legal and professional factors. There is room for disagreement here because as society evolves, its values change, but the law, which is inherently conservative, does not change as quickly.

Relativism Relativism holds that moral or ethical propositions do not reflect objective and/or universal moral truths, but instead make claims relative to social, cultural, historical or personal circumstances.

This is essentially an inward-looking approach to morality, with each person being their own ultimate authority on what is right action. In the subjective view, public morality is merely a reflection of social convention. Only personal, subjective morality expresses true authenticity. The French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre is a foremost exponent of this approach to morality. Cultural Relativism In contrast to the subjective approach, in Cultural Relativism a person’s beliefs and activities are understood in the context of his or her culture. Right action is defined by cultural convention and exists as a commonly understood principle in that culture. Since morality varies from culture to culture, with each culture having an equal claim as to what constitutes right action. This approach to morality grew out of the work of th anthropologist Franz Boaz in the early 20 century. Anthropologists, if they are to properly understand a culture must not impose moral judgments on their practices even if they differ from the anthropologist’s own cultural beliefs. A criticism of both subjective and cultural relativism is that they differ fundamentally and take no account of the other. Arguably, both approaches have merit, and both deserve to be"}

Kantianism Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) was a notable German philosopher who argued with good reason that morality be based on a standard of rationality that he dubbed the Categorical Imperative (CI). Immorality is therefore a violation of the CI and is irrational. The importance of being rational is a consistent theme in Western philosophy. The Stoic philosophers of classical Greece emphasises the use of logic and rationality to overcome the tendency to act emotionally and irrationally. Kant’s position can be summed in his categorical imperatives which form the foundation of his work. Categorical Imperative (First Formulation): Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law. Ask yourself, if I do this, would be all right if everyone did it? Categorical Imperative (Second Formulation): Act so that you always treat both yourself and other people as ends in themselves, and never only to an end. Ask yourself, am I exploiting someone to get what I want?"}

This position maintains that whatever you do must not harm other people or diminish them by treating them to an end. Kant’s theory belongs to the broader category of non- Consequentialist theories that determines whether an action is right or wrong by considering the underlying rule or principle that motivates the action. Social Contract theory is another member of this category. Utilitarianism Utilitarianism asserts that moral behaviour is that which promotes happiness or pleasure; that which creates the greatest good and/or does the least harm. A wrong act is one which produces unhappiness or suffering. The degree of ‘wrongness’ is determined by how much harm the act has caused. Therefore, the guiding principle in Utilitarianism is to do the thing that brings the greatest good to the greatest number.

Moral behaviour is therefore defined by whether we follow the rules. There are limits to how far Rule utilitarianism can be applied. When more and more exceptions to the rule are applied, it collapses into Act utilitarianism. More general criticisms of this view argue that it is possible to generate unjust rules by resorting to the principle of utility. For example, slavery in ancient Greece might have been right if it led to an overall achievement of cultivated happiness at the expense of some mistreated individuals. Social Contract theory Philosopher Thomas Hobbes argued that everybody living in a civilised society has implicitly agreed to (a) establish a set of moral rules to govern relations among citizens, and (b) establish a government capable of enforcing these rules. This is called the social contract. In practical terms, Social Contract theory might also be construed to be a kind of reciprocal social obligation, society to the individual, and the individual to society. When individuals live in a society and enjoy the benefits of doing so (a place to live, meaningful work, the chance to raise a family in safety and so on), they have a reciprocal obligation to contribute to that society in whatever way they are best able to do.

His leadership is based on the often-misunderstood Stoic philosophy. The power and relevance of this philosophy is as potent today as it was when he was Roman Emperor (161 to 180AD). Marcus Aurelius might have been a Roman, but his thinking had been shaped by the classical period of ancient Greece. Even today, classical Greek thinking is still at the foundations of Western civilisation. Influenced by the earlier work of Socrates and Diogenes of Sinope, the Stoic school of philosophy was founded around 300 BC by Zeno of Citium. Speaking from beneath a painted portico (Stoa Poikilē) in Athens, signifying openness to anyone passing by Zeno taught that a wise person should not allow their emotions to rule them; instead, they should master their emotions and use logic to think rationally about how to"}

He urged his followers to carefully study the laws of Nature and to live in harmony with them. In this respect his ideas coincide with those of far distant Lao Tzu, the ancient Chinese philosopher who wrote the Tao Te Ching. A central point in Stoic philosophy is the active relationship between the laws of Nature that rule the Cosmos, and human free will. A wise person derives maximum benefit and happiness in life by bringing his or her will into harmony with Nature. They come to know themselves, recognising that their inner nature (microcosm) is a representation of the outer macrocosm, or universe; it the same nature in both, only differing in scale. Stoics conceived of the universe as being governed by Logos, what we today would think of as the Laws of Physics. Pure, abstract, these laws pervade the universe and make it behave in the way it does. The same informing principle resides in humans. Virtue is therefore gained by recognising this and working to harmonise one’s inner self with the qualitatively similar outer world. The Greek founders of Stoicism conceived of three interrelated elements that collectively make Philosophy. These are logic, physics, and ethics. Logic allows us to recognise truth when we see it, and to avoid making mistakes. Logic allows us to understand Physics, which is the way the world operates, the laws of Nature. Together, Logic and Physics allows us to practice Ethics, or moral behaviour that brings benefit. Ethical behaviour is that which is in harmony with the"}

If we are to stay in accord with it, we must discipline our minds to become indifferent to suffering, accepting with grace that it is necessary and inevitable to suffer sometimes. This state of mind is called apatheia. Likewise, we must not become so attached to pleasure that we cannot relinquish it when it passes. The goal is to become self-sufficient, or autarcheia. The Stoic therefore becomes equally indifferent to good fortune or bad, whether they are rich or poor, well-respected or despised. They understand that the approval or disapproval of others can exert undue influence to conform to values that may not be true. The Stoic does his or her duty in accordance with Nature as revealed by careful observation and logical enquiry. They do their duty regardless of whether it is easy or hard. With its emphasis on duty and right action, Stoicism is therefore well-suited to the needs of those who would lead. It was used as a guide by the ruling class of Rome for centuries.

The foundation of Buddhist philosophy is the so-called Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eight-Fold Path. The eight-fold path aims to improve your (a) Wisdom by practicing right view and intention, (b) Ethical conduct by practicing right speech, action and livelihood, and (c) Mental capabilities by practicing right effort, mindfulness and concentration. We shall examine more closely the three aspects of ethical conduct. Right Speech Words are powerful. Words can make or break a person’s life, start wars or bring peace. Words can indeed be mightier than the sword, as great orators through the ages have proven. Right speech (including written words) is therefore the principle of expressing oneself in a way that enhances the quality of people’s lives and does no harm. It means to refrain from (a) lies and deceit, (b) malicious language (including slander), (c) angry or offensive language, and (d) idle chit-chat (including gossip).

Broadly, right action means refraining from (a) harming any sentient creature, (b) stealing, and (c) sexual misconduct. Doing no harm to others covers a very broad range of behaviours. The worst a person can do is to take the life of sentient creatures, hence many Buddhists are vegetarians. Not stealing includes all forms of robbery, theft, deceit and fraud; essentially taking what you have not earned the right to have. The ethical person is therefore kind and compassionate in their dealings with the world.

Lao Tzu & the Tao Te Ching The Tao Te Ching is said to have been written by Lao Tzu (604 – 531 BCE), the philosopher and Custodian of the Imperial Archives in the time of the Chou Dynasty in ancient China. It is uncertain when Lao Tzu was born or died, but he is said to be a contemporary of Confucius (551–479 BCE). Central to Taoist philosophy is the avoidance of extremes, to always seek the middle way on our journey through life. Find the middle ground between the extremes and occupy that space and in doing so have the fewest consequences to deal with. The principle at work here is that extreme action always results in an equal and opposite reaction. As a pendulum swings to one extreme, it will always swing to the other extreme in equal measure. Following the middle path reduces the “swing” to a minimum. Only through this practice can harmony in society be achieved.

The middle path requires us to develop an awareness of the physical forces that shape our world. Such forces operate uniformly at all levels from the largest to the smallest. They operate in the universe as a whole and in the minds and lives of individual people. An understanding of these natural laws and the forces they direct give us the power to influence events in the world without force. Influence is achieved through guiding rather than coercion. The objective is always to avoid taking action that will elicit strong counter-reactions. In Nature, an excessive force in a particular direction always triggers the growth of an opposing force, and therefore the use of force cannot be the basis for establishing an enduring social condition. We come to understand that everything in the universe is impermanent, in a state of change. The emotional and intellectual structures that we build for ourselves to feel secure are likewise subject to change by external forces that are largely beyond our control. The challenge is to accept the inevitability of change and not waste our energy trying to prop up these impermanent structures, defending them against criticisms, and trying to convince others to believe in them so that they might become recognised as permanent truth.

The Ethics of Confucius Confucius (551 BC – 479 BC) established a system of personal and governmental morality that has endured for 2,500 years. It concerns itself with correctness in social relations during a time of great disturbance. The work of Confucius and Lao Tzu are both aimed at achieving social harmony and coherence to remedy the rampant chaos of the times. Three key principles are emphasized in Confucius’ teachings: the principles of Li, Jen and Chun-Tzu. The term Li has several meanings; it is often translated as propriety, reverence, courtesy, ritual or ideal conduct. It is what Confucius believed to be the ideal standard of religious, moral, and social conduct. The second principal Jen is the fundamental virtue of Confucian teaching, the virtue of goodness and benevolence. It is expressed through recognition of value and concern for others, no matter their rank or class. Jen is summarised as the Silver Rule: Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you. (Analects 15:23) Li provides the structure for social interaction. Jen makes it a moral system. The third principle, Chun-Tzu describes the idea of the true gentleman (should not be seen as gender-specific). This is the person who lives according to the highest ethical standards."}

Ethical AI & Algorithmic Bias Ethical AI & Algorithmic Bias Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology that can enhance decision-making, optimize processes, and create new value in various domains. However, AI also poses ethical challenges that need to be addressed by IT professionals who design, develop, deploy, or use AI systems. One of the most pressing ethical issues in AI is algorithm bias, which is a kind of error or unfairness that can arise from the use of AI. What is algorithm bias and why does it matter? Algorithm bias is a situation where an AI system produces outcomes that are systematically skewed or inaccurate, often resulting in unfair or discriminatory treatment of individuals or groups based on their characteristics, such as race, gender, age, or disability. Algorithm bias can have negative impacts on human rights, such as the right to equality, privacy, dignity, and justice. Algorithm bias can occur for several reasons, such as: • The data used to train or test the AI system is not representative of the target population or context,"}

Data Privacy & Security Data privacy is the right of individuals to control how their personal data is collected, used, shared and stored by others. Data security is the protection of data from unauthorized access, use, modification or destruction. Data privacy and security are closely related, but not the same. Data privacy focuses on the rights and choices of individuals, while data security focuses on the technical and organizational measures to safeguard data. Implementing best practices for data privacy and security Here are some of the best practices for data privacy and security for technology for social good: Assess and classify data. First, assess your business data comprehensively to understand what types of data you have. Then, classify your data according to its sensitivity and the value it adds to your business. Practice minimal data collection. A rule of thumb when collecting data is to only collect what you need. Avoid collecting unnecessary or excessive data that may increase the risk of exposure or misuse."}

Accessibility & Inclusion The Digital Divide The digital divide is the gap that exists between those who have access to digital technology and the internet, and those who do not. It affects millions of people in Australia, especially in remote and regional areas, low-income households, older people, and people who speak a language other than English at home. The digital divide can limit people’s ability to participate in society, access essential services, communicate with others, learn new skills, and find opportunities. It can also increase social isolation, disadvantage, and inequality. There are ways to bridge the digital divide and promote digital inclusion. Digital inclusion means ensuring that everyone can access, afford, and use digital technology and the internet effectively. It also means helping people develop their digital ability, which is the knowledge, skills, and confidence to use digital technology safely and creatively. How to Measure Digital Inclusion One way to measure digital inclusion is to use the Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII). The ADII is a tool that uses survey data to measure digital inclusion across three dimensions: access, affordability, and digital ability. The ADII"}

The latest ADII report shows that digital inclusion at the national level is improving, but there are still significant gaps and challenges. For example, 11 per cent of Australians are “highly excluded” from digital services, meaning they do not have access to affordable internet or don’t know how to use it. That equates to about 2.8 million people. The report also shows that the divide between metropolitan and regional areas has narrowed but remains marked. People in capital cities are more likely to be online than those in regional areas, and unsurprisingly, low-income earners struggle to connect. There are different reasons for the digital divide – many older Australians lack online literacy, while in some areas a lack of infrastructure limits options. Bridging the Digital Divide Bridging the digital divide requires a collaborative effort from various stakeholders, including governments, businesses, community organisations, educators, researchers, and users themselves. Some of the strategies that can help bridge the digital divide are: • Improving the availability and quality of internet infrastructure and services in remote and regional areas • Providing affordable and flexible internet plans and devices for low-income households"}

What are the legal and ethical frameworks for accessibility and inclusion? There are several laws and standards that require organisations to provide accessible and inclusive products, services or information. These include: The Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (DDA), which makes it unlawful to discriminate against people with disability in various areas of public life, such as employment, education, accommodation, access to premises, goods, services and facilities. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which are internationally recognised standards for making web content accessible to people with disability. The Australian Government has adopted WCAG as the minimum level of accessibility for all government websites. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), which is an international treaty that promotes and protects the human rights of people with disability. Australia ratified the CRPD in 2008 and has obligations to ensure that people with disability can access information, communication, technology, education, health, employment, justice and other services on an equal basis with others."}

The size of datasets, and the aspects of people’s lives and behaviours that could potentially be exfiltrated, is a constantly upward trend. The magnitude of data exfiltration losses can be expected to increase in the future. Data breaches by business sector Other the past eight years, data exfiltration incidences have been most frequent in organizations involved in public sector, education and healthcare. Certain types of data are worth more than others and personal health records (PHI (Private Health Insurance)) and personal identifiable information (PII) are worth more on the black market, relative to credit cards and other personal finance records. The fact that these organizations hold more of these types of data, combined with potentially lower security standards, make these sectors more attractive targets. Recent incidence rates of data loss for different business sectors remain broadly consistent with previous patterns. Data breach rates have increased in IT services, manufacturing sectors, and have doubled in retail. An emerging recent target for data breaches has been offshore legal firms in tax havens, with a string of incidences of whistle-blower tax filings, including another exfiltration, following on from the Panama Papers in 2016, of the so- called ‘Paradise Papers’ where 1.4TB of sensitive financial and legal information about clients of offshore legal firm Appelby was leaked to the public."}

This is attributed to the regulatory costs, escalating legal complexity and growing cost of compensation. Costs of data exfiltration attacks vary significantly between countries and increases in countries with lower compensation costs have resulted in average costs worldwide apparently decreasing, but costs are generally increasing over time in many countries, as regulations tighten. The highest cost per record remains in the U.S. due to the increasing notification costs. Average costs per record are reported to have decreased recently in Western Europe, particularly in the U.K., Austria and Denmark. Costs of data breaches are expected to increase in Europe with the implementation of GDPR. Costs in other countries are likely to rise, such as Asia-Pacific countries as they move towards tougher data breach laws including the new Cyber Security Laws introduced in China. Cyber insurers are increasingly moving their larger insured accounts to ‘managed response’ relationships, where they control the claim costs when they occur, and this is managing to reduce the cost of data breaches in those client accounts. The business impact of a data breach has reduced, with some of the consequences having diminished, such as churn (number of customers lost due to a data breach) which has reduced in Western Europe."}

Ransomware attacks on the rise The use of ransomware, where malware is infiltrated into the networks of a company and disables servers or locks up data until a ransom is paid, has become one of the most pressing concerns for cyber security specialists. Attempts to extort major companies using cyber-attacks have grown in frequency, scope and ambition. Many companies have developed contingencies for ransomware attacks in the future. Some commentators have suggested that companies stockpiling BitCoin in case of extortion attacks may have fuelled the recent surges in BitCoin demand. Estimates of ransomware extorted in 2017 exceed five billion dollars, a 15-fold increase over the previous two years.

The Lazarus SWIFT financial theft in early 2016 was one of the most audacious cyber bank heists of its kind, which could have resulted in a theft of more than a billion dollars. The 2016 campaign successfully stole $81 million, with dozens of banks and central banks compromised including the U.S. Federal Reserve. The hackers hit the SWIFT network by repeatedly using specially-crafted software which allowed them to gather information on standard practices and send fraudulent requests for funds across the network. In response to the cyber-attack, SWIFT in 2017 announced an updated security protocol. The vulnerability was not in the SWIFT technology itself, but a weakness in the security of some of the member banks, so SWIFT introduced the Customer Security Control policy which gives advice on how to segregate SWIFT and critical systems from a member bank’s general framework.

Downtime for a CSP rarely translates to a shutdown of the entire cloud. Rather, CSP downtime often manifests in service interruption to a single service, or, in the case of interdependent services, all those associated with the single service. Interruption to ‘compute’ and ‘storage’ services have the potential to cause greatest impact on customers as interdependencies within the cloud are often traced back to these essential services. Isolation between CSP availability zones limits the impact of the down service(s) – aiming to prevent global interruption. Denial of Service Attacks Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) attacks continue to be a major component in the cyber risk landscape.

Instead of tactics focused on single aspect of a company’s infrastructure, DDoS attacks are taking a more diversified approach, alternating targets within a single attack including web application servers, firewalls, and other infrastructure components. Additionally, by varying the modes within of attack, an additional layer of complexity can be added. Attack types are broadly categorized into Volume Based Attacks, Protocol Attacks, and Application Layer Attacks each with a different method of overwhelming site bandwidth. The increased complexity of a multi-modal attack makes these attacks difficult for a company to defend its networks both proactively and reactively.

While this represents substantial growth, it remains modest in comparison with the overall commercial insurance market of $247 billion. It is also relatively small in comparison with the overall corporate cyber risk management spend, with Gartner reporting worldwide cybersecurity spending at over $75.4 billion. Drivers of growth A review of many cyber insurance policies seen by RMS suggests the growth in the U.S. has been driven by increased take up from non-traditional purchases of cyber insurance (outside healthcare, technology and retail), as well as additional"}

International growth has also played a key part, with several markets demonstrating strong growth including Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Looking more long term, RMS expects substantial growth for the industry driven by not just cyber but a broader category of digital risks. Businesses are becoming increasingly reliant on technology to run their operations and while this brings obvious benefits, it also means they are increasingly vulnerable to system failures, data losses and cyber-attacks. As the rate of technology change continues apace, the digital environment is likely to become even more complex and the amount of digital information will grow exponentially. Corporate risk managers need to develop comprehensive digital risk management strategies that involve a range of mitigations with risk transfer solutions through insurance being critical. Given the pervasive nature of technology as the foundation of the modern economy, digital risk provides a once in a generation opportunity for the insurance industry. Market participants and INCREASED COMPETITION The market continues to see a substantial concentration of premium within a handful of insurers. In the U.S. just 4 domestic writers and one Lloyd’s insurer generate almost 60% of all premium, according to an analysis of the NAIC statutory filings.

However, a key trend observed over the last two years has been the entrance of many new carriers. There are now more than insurers reporting cyber premiums, although their participation remains limited. In 2016, 68 insurers reported premiums greater than a million dollars, and of these only 28 had more than $5 million. The increased competition is having an impact, with rates reportedly down over the last 12 months as well as a general loosening of coverage terms. Despite high profile systemic cyber events over the last 12 months, the limited impact on the cyber insurance industry has likely only exacerbated this issue. International growth While most premiums emanate from the U.S., there are substantial signs of growth internationally, with Europe, Japan and Australia all seeing significant rises in GWP, albeit from a relatively small base.

Loss processes RMS analysis shows that breach of privacy events (such as data exfiltration) continues to contribute the largest financial impact to losses. As has been widely reported, the proliferation of ransomware (see previous section) has resulted a large spike in the frequency of extortion and BI claims. To date the costliest losses have been driven by individual large loss events rather than more systemic events. This has had the impact of spreading the losses unevenly across insurers, with loss ratios varying substantially between carriers, with writers of larger corporates seeing volatile losses. Some have been fortunate enough to return single digit loss ratios while others have ratios greater than 150%.

Cyber Reinsurance The cyber reinsurance market has continued to develop over the last 12 months. Insurers are now more aware of the potential for systemic incidents to trigger substantial losses and are looking to the reinsurance market to transfer some of this risk off their balance sheets. Most reinsurance contracts remain as per risk quota share with some aggregate stop loss terms adding additional protection for the reinsurer. However, over the last 12 months RMS is seeing several brokers structuring more complex treaties including excess of loss. Managing Cyber Exposure Driven by increased regulatory pressures and improved awareness at the board level, insurers have looked to implement practices to manage cyber risk. However, substantial challenges exist in providing the clear visibility required. As many commentators have stated, cyber coverage can be found in numerous other lines of business, including property, general liability, crime, kidnap and ransom, and potentially many others. This is either through endorsements or silent ‘non-affirmative’ coverage."}

Some of the main challenges are with the inconsistency in policy wordings, ambiguity in the strength of exclusions, and varying data quality approaches to data capture across multiple often legacy systems. The clear need for visibility into cyber risk has led insurers to tackle these challenges head on. RMS has worked with many insurers over the last 12 months to implement robust but practical exposure management approaches leading to significantly improved visibility. Pricing Cyber Risk Approaches to pricing cyber risk have yet to come to a consensus across the industry. A review of the rate fillings provided to insurance commissioners in the U.S. highlight the challenges of pricing cyber risk given the limited historical data and the relatively dynamic peril. Among the approaches documented includes borrowing from other classes; “we chose to use fiduciary liability data because it has a similar limit profile and expected development pattern [as cyber losses]”, and “factors are taken from our Miscellaneous Professional Liability product”– a less than ideal approach."}

However, approaches to assigning return periods to losses, and thereby supporting the inclusion of modelled results within capital modelling applications have to date been limited. These challenges highlight the need for improved data and risk models to support the industry’s growth in a resilient manner. 9.3 Ransomware Insurance and Recovery Strategies Ransomware is a particularly malicious form of software that encrypts a victim’s files, holding them hostage until a ransom is paid.

However, obtaining this insurance often requires companies to demonstrate that they have certain security measures in place. Many policies also provide access to expert help during an attack, which can be invaluable in navigating the complex process of response and recovery. Pros and Cons of Ransomware Insurance While ransomware insurance can provide important financial protection, it’s not without controversy. Some argue that the existence of insurance may actually incentivize attackers by guaranteeing ransom payments. Additionally, these policies can be expensive, particularly for organizations in high-risk industries. Organizations must carefully weigh these pros and cons when deciding whether to invest in ransomware insurance."}

Backup and Recovery Processes Backup and recovery processes are also critical. Organizations should maintain regular, comprehensive backups stored offline or in secure cloud locations. It’s not enough to simply have backups – the restoration process should be tested regularly to ensure it works when needed. Care must be taken to ensure that backup copies themselves remain free from malware. Incident Response Planning When an attack occurs, having a well-prepared incident response plan can make a significant difference. This plan should detail the steps to be taken in the event of an attack, including roles and responsibilities for various team members. Regular drills and updates to this plan help ensure it remains effective."}

If negotiation with the attackers becomes necessary, it should only be done through experienced negotiators. Organizations must carefully consider the legal and ethical implications of paying a ransom, and understand that payment doesn’t guarantee successful data recovery. Data Recovery Efforts Data recovery efforts may involve using decryption tools if they’re available for the specific ransomware variant. More often, it involves restoring from clean backups after ensuring the threat has been completely eliminated. Following an incident, a thorough investigation should be conducted to understand how the attack occurred and what additional security measures can be implemented to prevent future incidents.

Of the roughly 400 million actively-used Windows computers running version 8 or earlier operating system, approximately 0.1 percent were infected. The great majority of the Windows computers running version 8 or earlier were protected by a Microsoft patch MS17-010 issued two months earlier, in March 2017. The event highlighted the issue of equipment software latency, i.e. that machines and sub-networks within organizations may rely on specific versions of operating system that render them vulnerable. In these cases, although most systems within organizations ran more up-to-date operating systems, certain departments and activities were maintaining the older versions that contained the vulnerability. Machines such as medical MRI scanners and X-Ray machines that were certified on XP and v8 and maintained on those operating systems, were among those that were crippled by the attack.73 Businesses reported substantial losses from lock- outs of systems around the world, such as manufacturing processes, dispatch and ordering systems, gas pump payment applications, and telephone exchange equipment. We estimate the direct costs and indirect business disruption losses from WannaCry to be around half a billion dollars.

No company that paid a ransom got its data back. The motivation was more likely to sabotage some of the affected companies, rather than generate funds for the hackers. It is possible that the widespread economic disruption was collateral damage to mask a targeted destructive attack. The propagation of WannaCry was stopped after four days by a researcher finding a kill-switch within the software. Otherwise the infection could have spread to many more machines and had a more severe impact. RMS counterfactual analysis suggests that if the kill-switch had not been triggered, and if the attack had occurred prior to the issuing of the MS17-010 patch for Windows 8, the infection rates and losses could have been an order of magnitude higher, perhaps reaching $3 to $6 billion."}

Authentication Methods Authentication methods have evolved significantly over the years. Password-based systems, while still common, are increasingly seen as inadequate on their own. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has become a standard practice, combining something you know (like a password), something you have (like a phone), and something you are (like a fingerprint). Biometric authentication, using physical characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, is becoming more prevalent in both consumer devices and high-security environments. Challenges in Digital Identity Despite advancements, digital identity systems face several challenges. Privacy concerns are paramount, as these systems often involve collecting and storing sensitive personal information. Security is another major concern, with identity theft and fraud remaining persistent threats. Inclusivity is also a challenge, as digital identity systems must be accessible to all members of society, including those with limited tech literacy or access."}

After this year, he would return to full time study and complete the final year. This extended a three year degree to four years, but Luke was OK about this because he was able to land an intern job with a leading interactive design studio (TT INTERACTIVE) that worked closely with advertising agencies to develop the web component of major ad campaigns.

Luke was part of a three person project team. It was a demanding but highly satisfying project that was almost finished by the time he finished his intern year, and was due to return to university for the final year. TT were a hard task- master. Though he was being paid the bare minimum, he was expected to work long hours. He was told the experience he was getting was worth a lot. Nonetheless, he had mixed feelings; on the one hand he was indeed getting some great experience, but he could not help feeling somewhat exploited by TT management who seemed to care more about project outcomes than the people making the project happen. Luke was a careful person by nature, and routinely made backups of the project files that he stored off-site for safe- keeping. He had lost hours of work before and was in the habit of making off-site backups.

He felt like he was making a difference in the world. Despite some teething problems, and some disparaging comments from his fellow students, the new portal was a success. He felt justifiably proud of himself. When he finished his degree he had been told there would probably be a job for him at TT but they were by this time fully staffed. Luke was a free agent in the world, looking for a way to apply his talents. With the experience he now had as a co-developer of a major new portal he was able to secure a similar position at a rival studio, Tangential. A year goes by, and Luke has settled in to his new job at Tangential. He becomes a team leader in due course. One day his boss calls him in for a conversation. How would Luke like to take the lead on a project to develop a web portal for Charleston Technical University? Tangential have successfully tendered for the project. This is important. Tangential management is quite excited about it. The boss hints that anything Luke might have “learned” while at TT INTERACTIVE would be helpful.

The upshot of the meeting is that Luke enthusiastically accepts the challenging new team lead role on the Charleston Technical University web portal project. Without any discussion with anyone, he digs out his old backups of the Altiora project (done while at TT) and dusts them off. Yes, he decides, this could be useful; this could be the framework that will save a lot of time and effort. He wonders briefly whether he is doing the right thing, but finishes by telling himself that “This is my own work. Don’t I have a right to use it? Why reinvent the wheel?” So Luke takes his earlier work (and that of his fellow developers at TT who worked on the Altiora project) and modifies it so that it is superficially different from the original (a user would not notice much similarity), but under the skin, at a programming level, it was largely based on his earlier work.

This is a legal factor because the work Luke used was not his own. This is a breach of Australian copyright law Professional Factors Factor 3, Professional Contract Obligations As described earlier Luke Vandenberg made a breach of his contract with TT INTERACTIVE. This is not only a legal factor but also a professional factor as is stated in the Australian computer society’s code of professional conduct and professional practice under H3. Factor 4, Professional Confidentiality Luke copied the intellectual property of his previous employer, TT INTERACTIVE without permission. Copying the Altiora"}

Employment & Social Factors Factor 5, Luke cheated TT INTERACTIVE As mentioned Luke copied the Altiora web portal he worked on at TT INTERACTIVE and used it in a similar project for rival company Tangential software. Society does not like cheaters and thieves. By copying the Altiora project without crediting TT INTERACTIVE, Luke effectively stole the project and cheated TT INTERACTIVE and its employees. Luke Vandenberg is a member of society; he should have contributed to society. Instead, Luke behaved like a parasite, taking without giving credit or giving back to the organization he was once a part of. Factor 6, Luke was treated poorly at TT INTERACTIVE Luke was made to work long, hard hours whilst working at TT INTERACTIVE. Luke had mixed feelings about his time at TT INTERACTIVE. Luke was getting good experience but he felt that he was worked too hard for his minimum wage. TT INTERACTIVE worked Luke very hard which could have made Luke feel oppressed. This is a social factor because people in society usually resent those whom oppress them or take away their freedom. Society has a general dislike for bullies like TT INTERACTIVE."}

Luke breached this contract by making off-site backups. This is a social factor because society generally does not like it when people break promises. For example when a government party promises to lower taxes and does not deliver on the promise, people in society become resentful towards party. Factor 8, Luke’s boss pressured him Luke’s boss at Tangential asked him to use whatever he had learned from the previous project. Luke felt that his boss’ manner was odd. This was because the boss knew about Luke’s copy of the Altiora web portal project and was suggesting that Luke copy this work for the new Tangential web portal project. This is an employment factor because Luke’s boss suggested he take part in an un- professional act. Factor I, Luke was misled Luke was told that there would probably be a place for him at TT INTERACTIVE after he finished his university degree however TT INTERACTIVE did not have a place for him. This is an employment factor because the organisation, TT INTERACTIVE may have disappointed Luke. Personal Factors Factor 10, Luke committed plagiarism Luke committed plagiarism by copying the Altiora web portal project without"}

This is a personal factor because Luke’s personal environment was once at Altiora University and universities are very strict on plagiarism. Factor 11, Luke was from an I.T (Information Technology) background Luke made off-site copies of the Altiora web portal project whilst at TT INTERACTIVE. Luke made these copies because he wanted to make sure he did not lose his work. Also when Luke copied TT INTERACTIVE’s web portal he said to himself, “Why reinvent the wheel?” These are personal factors because they come from Luke’s information technology background. Factor 12, Peer pressure Luke’s boss at Tangential subtly told Luke to copy what he could from TT INTERACTIVE’s web portal project. This is a personal factor because Luke’s boss applied peer pressure on Luke. It is part of what caused Luke to copy TT INTERACTIVE’s web portal project. Intrinsic Factors Factor 13, Luke’s personal gain Luke wanted the new project with Tangential to go successfully as this may lead to Luke getting ahead in the industry. Luke had ambitions to open his own studio in the hopes of earning enough money so he and his wife could move into a larger home. This is a personal factor because it is what motivated Luke to copy TT INTERACTIVE’s Altiora web portal project."}

This is what led him to making off-line backups of the Altiora web portal project. This is an intrinsic factor because it is to do with Luke’s own experiences and it is part of who he is as a person. Factor O, Luke’s mixed feelings toward TT INTERACTIVE Luke had mixed feelings about working at TT INTERACTIVE and felt he was taken advantage of. This is an intrinsic factor as it is part of Luke’s own experiences and Luke may have felt negatively towards TT INTERACTIVE because of it. Sample Solution 2 Legal factors The first subject I have in this list of legal factors is the intellectual property theft. The reason I have chosen this as the first legal priority is because while Luke was working at TT he was taking backups of his work off site which is legally the property of TT. Although he may have been under the assumption that he was doing the right thing for TT by making off site backups, it does not eliminate the fact that being ignorant of the law does not make it ok to break the law. The second legal factor which is still within relation of the first is the breach of agreement that Luke has committed. Being employed by TT and gaining the work experience he was achieving I’m sure Luke could have been intelligent enough"}

The third legal factor is when Luke breached the privacy legislation. The time he was having a few drinks then he had mentioned to the Tangential manager that he still had backups of the work he done when he was working at TT interactive. This act is highly unethical. This action has created a negative reaction further down the lines when the Tangential manager calls him in for chat about the new project of the portal. The fourth is confidentiality as at the point when without hesitation Luke used his original backups from TT as the framework for his new project with Tangential & spoke to his boss about the work he had done with TT. The fifth legal factor is that Mr Vandenberg has breached his own Code of ethical conduct as he had committed the above breaches mentioned and never owned up to his mistake hence decreasing the integrity of himself. The sixth legal breach that has been committed is piracy at the time in the case study when Luke used the framework from TT as the framework for Tangential web portal. Professional factors The night that Luke was having few drinks with his manager from Tangential & he mentioned that he still had backups of the work he had done while he was employed by a rival competitor at TT interactive.

The news of the new project they are beginning for the web portal gets informed to Luke. The next instant Luke catches hints from his employer about the backups he had from the last portal that he had designed at TT would be a great asset to the project. Could this be the reason Luke was given the opportunity to be the Lead worker of this project? Employment and Social factors Despite Luke received disparaging comments from fellow students he was still justifiably happy with the web portal produced by TT. The time Luke was working at TT INTERACTIVE he was doing long hours and earning the base wage minimum. The justification of this circumstance was that the fact that the experience he is receiving is much more treasured. However Luke still felt underappreciated and what some could say being de humanised slightly. No gratitude was being acknowledged towards the workers just to the future outcomes of the project being completed. The fact that Luke was an existing student at Altiora University assisted in TT interactive giving him the internship as they wanted someone who was familiar with the culture at the university."}

His priority was that just after recently getting married Luke & his wife discussed that they would like to have a bigger place and possibly have children (family) one day. Intrinsic factors Luke has attended university for 4 years in total. Luke was required to do 1 year work experience as part of his multimedia degree. This was the time when TT interactive was doing the web portal for Altiora University. The entire project had taken the whole entire year that Luke was doing as work experience. This also gave him co-developer experience. Once Luke went back to university for his final year he was under the impression that he would have a job at TT however this was not the case as TT was fully staffed on the completion of Luke’s degree. None the less Luke gained employment at a competitor of TT called Tangential. As time goes by with his employment Luke becomes Team leader at Tangential. The opportunity arises that would help him get ahead in the industry. Further along down the line Luke becomes a senior"}

Work for us, but we won’t pay you It is common practice for unscrupulous employers to hire interns; enthusiastic, usually young developers on low or non- existent salary, on the understanding that the experience they are getting is adequate compensation.

The costly patch It is common practice by some software development companies to release defective software to their clients and then charge them to fix the defects that should not be there in the first place.

No, that doesn’t fit with our strategy Software development companies with an idea for a software product will often look for a client who is willing to finance the production of the software which will then be sold to as many of the client’s competitors as possible. If the client can be persuaded to pay full price, then so much the better. To secure the deal, the developer may offer a discount. The client probably realises that they are funding a project that will not only benefit them, but also their competitors. Perhaps they trust a non-disclosure agreement with the developer to safeguard their interests. This trust may prove to be misplaced. As development proceeds, there are sure to be times when the client says to the developer, thinking about it, we now want the software to do this or that (specific requirements). Unless this fits with the developer’s own product strategy, the client is likely to be told, no that cannot be done.

Two sets of accounts Some businesses that accept cash money have been known to keep two sets of accounts; one for the purposes of paying tax, the other to tell the full financial story strictly for in-house use. As a software professional working on an organisation’s accounts, you are likely to see information that your employer expects you to keep confidential. It may only be relatively minor matters, not necessarily a whole second set of book. Confidentiality of the employer-employee relationship is extremely important in professional practice. Like a doctor or lawyer, what you learn must not be disclosed to a third party except under certain prescribed circumstances. Becoming a whistle-blower is an extreme act, though sometimes it is justified. Before doing it, it is highly recommended that you seek the advice of your professional association. With good advice, your ethical concerns can be resolved without breaching your obligation to treat your employer’s information confidentially.

Even for those among us who identify as introverts and claim not to need people, it is still a question of degree as to how suggestible we are. An essential skill of the ethical technologist, and indeed the self-aware citizen of the world, is to recognise when attempts are being made to manipulate us by playing on our emotions.

The IPS suggests specific defences for each technique, as seen in italics below. Name calling Name calling is declaring something is bad without any real evidence. No further discussion or investigation is required. The matter is closed. The bad name is the conclusion that we should all accept and start repeating. It works to create fear and loathing towards the target, and it can be applied against individuals, groups, belief systems, religions, institutions and nations. Name calling is a substitute for a reasoned weighing up of the merits of something. It is characterised by a tone of scorn, sarcasm and ridicule. The best way to deal with this technique is to calmly ask yourself what does the name really mean? Is there a real connection between the idea and the name being used? Does the idea have merit if the name is left out? Glittering Generalities Propagandists as well as charismatic leaders are adept at using catchphrases that connect with deeply held values and beliefs in the audience. Little or no supporting evidence is given. Glittering generalities appeal to abstract ideas like honour, glory, love of country, desire for peace, security, freedom and family values. The words used are vague enough to mean what"}

Transfer The Transfer technique tries to extend the authority and approval of something or someone we respect to something the propagandist would have us believe. Symbols play an important role with this technique, for example flag waving or idealised images of womanhood or manhood, anything that can stir the emotions and win our approval. The best defence is to calmly ask yourself what exactly is the speaker trying to pitch? What does it mean? Is there a legitimate connection between the suggestion and the person or product?

The best defence is to calmly ask yourself who exactly is this authority figure? Is there a good reason we should believe they are qualified to make this recommendation? Is there any merit to what is being proposed? The technique falls apart if you can see that the person is not actually an authority but somebody with a secret agenda, or show that other experts disagree with them. Plain Folks The Plain Folks technique presents a spokesperson from humble origins, a simple, decent, good-natured person who has our best interests at heart. The spokesperson uses common, everyday speech and mannerisms to get people to identify with them and so accept their point of view. The best defence is to calmly ask yourself is this person believable and trustworthy when removed from the situation being discussed? Are they trying to cover up anything? What are the facts of the situation? Try to consider the ideas contained in the proposal separately from the personality of the presenter."}

It creates the impression that something has widespread support, and plays on the instinct to be on the winning side. It also plays on feelings of loneliness or social isolation if these are present. The message simultaneously encourages those not on the bandwagon to join, and for those already on the bandwagon to stay on board. A variation is to say if you do not join now, you will be left behind, abandoned. Either way, a person is encouraged to get with the strength on-board the bandwagon. The best defence is to calmly ask yourself what exactly is the propagandist’s program? What are the pro’s and con’s of the program? Others might be supporting it, but is there a good reason for me to do so? Card Stacking In the Card Stacking technique, the propagandist cherry-picks only those facts that strongly support their case, while presenting their opponent’s case in the worst possible light. It is dishonest because we are being urged to accept a carefully selected sub-set of the truth as the whole truth. The technique is difficult to detect because it does not present all the information necessary to make an informed decision, while implying that this is the whole truth."}

If you find yourself in such an environment, at the very least you should be aware of what kind of people you are associating with and becoming like. You would be well-advised to leave gracefully and as soon as possible."}

How can we reconcile the existence, if not the need for military technology in the world when its primary purpose appears to be to dehumanise, often in the most extreme ways? Kill-bots This truly is a dilemma that remains unresolved. This appendix tries to unravel the issues so that we may see them more clearly. The military ethicist Peter W. Singer of the Brookings Institute (not to be confused with Peter A. Singer who is a professor of Bioethics at Princeton University) concluded in a 2010 article in the Journal of Military Ethics that in a world of ‘killer apps’, robotic weapons that can function autonomously, it is necessary to open up a constructive dialogue on how to deal with the moral dilemmas created by this new category of weaponry."}

Singer notes that throughout history, certain technological advances have been ‘game-changers’. For example the printing press, gunpowder, the steam engine, or the atomic bomb. Not only are the current military technologies game-changers, they are part of a cresting wave of advances that are coming at us thick and fast. These include directed energy weapons (Lasers), precision guided weapons (‘smart’ IEDs), nanotech and microbotics (The Diamond Age), bioagents and genetic weaponry (DNA bombs), chemical and hardware enhancements to the human body (IronMan meets Captain America), autonomous armed robots (Terminators), electromagnetic pulse weaponry (The Day After, Ocean’s 11), and space weaponry (Star Wars). These may seem to be the stuff of science-fiction, but all of them are currently in development and are likely to be deployed in active service around 2030 or sooner. History clearly shows us that many of the technologies that we use and depend on in everyday life have their origins as military technology that has become de-classified and then commercialised. Indeed, the modern phenomenon of computer technology owes much to trying to win World War II. For example, in the U.S. the ENIAC machines were developed to help the US Army with artillery aiming by quickly calculating ballistic trajectories. In Germany, Konrad Zuse and his Z series computers were helping the German war- effort in no small way. In Britain, the Colossus computer was developed to decode the German Enigma cipher that allowed"}

These were truly breakthrough, game-changing technologies. Highly secret at the time, in the 1950’s and beyond, much of this computer technology was later commercialised, leading st to the world as we know it now in the 21 Century. Indeed, wars and conflict throughout human history have been responsible for rapid advances in technology. It is a little- known fact that Leonardo da Vinci, known for his love of humanity, not to mention his art and science, was also a well- paid military engineer whose inventions helped the wealthy city states of Renaissance Italy defend themselves against plunderers. Us and them The tendency for one group of people to go to war with another group is deeply ingrained in human nature, as evolutionary psychology recognises. As a species, humans evolved in cooperative groups (extended families). Loyalty to the group was essential for survival because the scarcity of resources meant that one group would often get what it needed at the expense of another group, inevitably leading to conflict. We have all heard of the term ‘us and them’ and instinctively understand the concept of in-groups and out- groups."}

Much of this book focuses on just this point. Realistically, instincts can never be gotten rid of or repressed; they can only be transcended or over-ridden by logic. One strategy is to transcend the ‘us and them’ mind-set that makes us see ‘them’ as sub-human and so be able to kill them in good conscience, with the more enlightened attitude that ‘us and them’ in the modern world is an illusion. We are all one species, all essentially the same under the skin, all of us members of the one big human family. If we widen our ‘circle of care’ as the other Peter Singer (from Princeton) suggests, from our immediate family to include an ever-widening circle of people in the world, then we will naturally come to act more compassionately towards everyone, not just our immediate family. Another strategy is put forward by Robert Wright in his 2001 book Nonzero: the logic of human destiny. He makes the compelling point that we are less likely to want to go to war against someone if we have an economic connection with them, such that by harming them, we harm ourselves. It does not make sense to hurt our own interests. The global economy st in the 21 century is a single interconnected entity. We can no longer act in isolation. The consequences of our actions are transmitted everywhere."}

This point being once reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races.’ ― Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man. Wright’s and Darwin’s perspectives can help us to transcend the ‘us and them’ mentality that has kept humanity perpetually at war throughout our blood-stained history. It will take a long time for the world to change because there is immense inertia built-up in the system, but the observable trend suggests that the change will come in time. Perhaps not soon enough for some but come it will. In practical terms, where does this leave us now? We currently live in a world where war is still a reality. There are bad actors who would go on the offensive unless their intended victims are well-defended. If nations are going to safeguard their interests, there will be a continuing, though hopefully lessening need for military technology to support this imperative. Seven questions Professor Singer suggests these seven questions to help a technologist decide what an ethical course of action is:"}

From whom is it ethical to take research and development money? From whom should one refuse to accept funding? 2. What attributes should one design into a new technology, such as its weaponization, autonomy or intelligence? What attributes should be limited or avoided? 3. What organizations and individuals should be allowed to buy and use the technology? Who should not? 4. What type of training or licensing should the users have? 5. When someone is harmed because of the technology’s actions, who is responsible? How is this determined? 6. Who should own the wealth of information the technology gathers about the world around them? Who should not? As a general principle, the abuse of something should not in itself prohibit the use of it. The potential for people to abuse something should not prevent it from being used in non- harmful ways. Motor cars and drugs would be two examples out of many. Military technology would be another. If the net good outweighs the net harm, a compelling argument exists to use it. Where to draw the line is often unclear. Each case must be considered individually and on its merits."}

La cybersécurité vise à garantir le fonctionnement \"normal\" (nonimal) d’un système numérique. Bien que ce fonctionnement normal (\"goodware\") soit difficile à définir formellement, l’idée est que le système reste conforme à un cahier des charges. Le but d’un attaquant est de modifier le comportement (\"behavior\") du système numérique et/ou d’accéder à des informations confidentielles. Un système numérique est composé de processeurs, associés à des mémoires hébergeant des programmes et des données. Des canaux d’entrées sorties (I/O) permettent des interactions locales (clavier, écran…) ou distantes (réseaux…) avec des humains ou des machines. Les applications numériques sont multiples, véhicules autonomes, supervision de processus industriels, commerce électronique, échange d’information multimédia, réseau domotique… La surface d’attaque, et donc le périmètre de défense de la cybersécurité, est complexe à appréhender, les technologies (microélectronique, algorithmes, protocoles…) ayant évoluées sous la pression du marché, en l’absence de pré-requis de sécurité.

IN2 IN1 PROG1 PROG2 GLUEWARE OUT1 OUT2 Ordinateurs et sécurité des applications Dans un premier temps1 les composants logiciels des applications étaient logés dans un même système informatique, constituant de fait leur média de communication (parfois dénommé gluware). Le bus système permet le transfert des informations stockées en mémoire, les modules logiciels sont réalisés par des processus gérés par le système d’exploitation. La sécurité est uniquement dépendante des caractéristiques du système d’exploitation, par exemple en termes de gestion des droits utilisateurs, ou d’isolement des processus. Le transistor a été inventé fin 1947 par John Bardeen, William Shockley et Walter Brattain (prix Nobel de physique en 1956). L'entreprise INTEL fondée en 1968 par les docteurs Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce et Andrew Grove, créa en 1971 le premier microprocesseur 4 bits (le 4004, comportant 2300 transistors). Un microprocesseur CISC (complex instruction set computer) est organisé autour d’une unité arithmétique et logique (ALU) qui exécute des micro-instructions (µI) stockées dans la mémoire du microprogramme (µP). Dans ce cas l’intégrité du µP est le point zéro de la confiance. Dans le modèle RISC (reduced instruction set computing) il n’y a pas de µP, les instructions sont exécutées par un décodeur d’instruction. Le PDP-11 (Programmable Data Processor) commercialisé par Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) dans la période 1970 et 1993 a popularisé l'architecture classique des ordinateurs comprenant, un CPU, un bus système, des mémoires, et des dispositifs d'entrée/sortie (I/O). 1 Un des premiers ordinateurs, \"Colossus\", a été construit en 1944 par l'équipe de Tommy Flowers selon les spécifications de Max Newman. Il comportait dans sa dernière version, 2400 tubes à vide. Pascal Urien – Télécom Paris – Introduction à la Cyber Sécurité"}

Remarquons à ce propos qu’il est possible de sécuriser une liaison de type point à point par un dispositif matériel de chiffrement.

Cette approche est à la base du concept du Cloud Computing, le client est équipé d’un terminal léger comportant un navigateur ou une machine virtuelle, la sécurité d’accès au service repose sur des technologies WEB. Annoncé en 2007, l’iPhone marque le début de l’internet mobile. De par sa nature, le stockage de données sensibles dans un objet portable implique la disponibilité de composants électroniques sécurisés adaptés (perte, vol, hacking…) tels que Secure Elements (contrôleur NFC, carte SIM/USIM) ou Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). L’Architecture Logicielle Réseau selon REST Dans sa thèse de doctorat, \"Architectural Styles and the Design of Network- based Software Architectures\", publiée en 2000, Thomas Fielding (Université d’Irvine, CA, USA) définit le concept d’architecture REST (Representational State Transfer). L’idée est d’extraire du protocole HTTP les principes de son efficacité. Il introduit la notion d’architecture logicielle (distribuée) sous forme d’un assemblage de trois types d’éléments, les composants, les connecteurs et les données: - Un composant (component) est un bloc abstrait d’instructions et d’états machine qui traite les données reçues via son interface. - Un connecteur (connector) est un mécanisme abstrait qui organise la communication, la coordination, et la coopération entre composants. - Un datum est un élément d’information reçu ou transmis par un composant via un connecteur. Une architecture REST est une généralisation du WEB; ses principales caractéristiques sont les suivantes : - Deux types d’entités les clients et les serveurs (Client-Server).

Dans un contexte REST la sécurité du réseau consiste à garantir l’intégrité et la confidentialité des données échangées entre composants. Sécurité du Cloud Selon la définition du NIST (Special Publication 800-145, 2011), le cloud computing est un modèle qui permet un accès efficace, omniprésent, et à la demande, à un ensemble (pool) partagé de ressources informatiques configurables (telles que réseaux, serveurs, stockage, applications et services). Ces ressources peuvent être provisionnées rapidement et libérées avec un effort de gestion minimal (c’est la notion d’élasticité), et une interaction réduite avec le fournisseur de services. Il est important de remarquer que l'infrastructure est la propriété du fournisseur de service (service provider). Modèle du Cloud - NIST Special Publication 800-145 Ce modèle est composé de cinq caractéristiques essentielles, trois modèles de service, et quatre modèles de déploiement. Les cinq caractéristiques essentielles sont: 1) la provision de ressources à la demande et en self service, 2) l'accès aux ressources via le réseau, à partir de clients légers, 3) le partage de ressources multi utilisateurs et géographiquement distribuées, 4) l'élasticité des ressources disponibles, 5) la mesure de la consommation des ressources.

Quelques plateformes logicielles pour l'IoT L'internet des objets combine un système informatique de type embarqué et une interface de communication telle que Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) ou ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4). Un objet se décompose généralement en quatre entités logiques et matérielles: 1) un circuit électronique (board) qui comporte typiquement un processeur, 2) un SOC (System On Chip) radio, 3) un système d'exploitation ou un bootloader, 4) une pile de communication et un environnement (framework) applicatif. La syntaxe des messages d’application s'appuie sur JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), un format d'échange de données (Data Interchange Format) en mode texte. La structure d'un arbre JSON est décrite par un schéma JSON. Un document JSON comprend deux types d'éléments structurels : des ensembles de paires clé (key), valeur (value), et des listes ordonnées de valeurs. Les messages applicatifs sont échangés selon le paradigme REST, à l'aide des protocoles HTTP ou CoAP.

De surcroit des mécanismes de contrôle d'accès utilisant des ACLs (Access Control List) ou des jetons (OAuth 2.0 Authentication), peuvent être implémentés dans la couche applicative. Le transport de paquets IPv6 natifs, dont le MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit, taille de paquet minimale transmise sans fragmentation) est de 1280 octets, n'est pas compatible avec la taille maximale de 127 octets des trames IEEE 802.15.4 (les entêtes IPv6 et TCP occupent au moins 40+20 octets). Le standard 6LoWPAN11 (IPv6 Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) finalisé en 2007 (RFC 4919) définit une couche d'adaptation (adaptative layer) qui réalise des opérations de segmentation/assemblage et également des modes de routage, internes à la couche d'adaptation (mesh-under) ou implémentée dans la couche IPv6 (route-over). Un réseau 6LoWPAN comprend des nœuds ordinaires (Host), des routeurs (Routers) et un routeur de bord (Edge Router) connecté au réseau IPv6. L'adresse IPv6 (128 bits) d'un nœud comporte un suffixe de 64 bit basé sur l'adresse MAC et un préfixe alloué selon le protocole Neighbor Discovery Router Advertisement (RA). Le protocole IPSEC est bien sur compatible avec cet environnement.

Thread Le consortium Thread définit une pile réseau s'appuyant sur 6LoWPAN et un routage de type route-over (Distance Vector Routing). La sécurité est délivrée par une couche DTLS munie du mécanisme d'authentification symétrique J-PAKE (Juggling Password-Authenticated Key Exchange), implémentant un mécanisme NIZK (Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge), à l'aide d'échanges Diffie-Hellmann sur des courbes elliptiques, et de signature de Schnorr. Selon Thread un objet (joiner) s'identifie auprès d'un serveur d'authentification (Commissioner) localisé dans l'internet, selon un protocole nommé Petitioning. Cette opération est réalisée à l'aide d'une connexion point à point avec un commissioner, le routeur de bord (border router) ou un routeur. Le commissioner est un nœud IPv6 ou IPv4; dans ce dernier cas il est nécessaire de traiter les messages DTLS via un proxy.

Un processeur d’objet est équipé de mémoires non volatiles de type ROM (non effaçable) ou FLASH (effaçable).

La programmation de mémoire FLASH implique la mise en d’œuvre d’un programmeur et d’un protocole particulier, tel que JTAG (Joint Test Action Group), protocole parallèle (utilisant un ensemble de signaux dédiés), ou SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface). SPI est un protocole très répandu basé sur deux canaux séries et quatre signaux: SCLK (serial clock), MOSI (master out slave in), MISO (master in slave out), et SS (slave select).

Le SoC intègre une ROM de 64 Ko, un ensemble de RAM (environ 80 Ko, y compris le cache des instructions), 80 Ko de mémoire DRAM pour les données utilisateur et une mémoire FLASH externe (jusqu'à 16 Mo). Certains ESP8266 supportent un boot sécurisé, c’est-à-dire que le micrologiciel stocké dans la FLASH est chiffré par une clé AES, gravée dans une mémoire OTP. La ROM contient un bootloader qui réalise à l’aide d’une fonction UART et d’un logiciel dédié (ESP FLASH Download Tool) le chargement du micrologiciel. Espressif Systems fournit un kit de développement logiciel sans OS (SDK NONOS) comportant des bibliothèques compilées (notamment une pile TCP/IP) et des codes sources ouverts. La plupart des modules ESP8266 sont fabriqués par la société Ai-Thinker sous la marque \"ESP-xx\". AVR AVR est une famille de microcontrôleurs 8 bits RISC commercialisés par la société ATMEL rachetée en 2016 par Microchip Technology. L’architecture AVR a été conçue en 1992 par deux étudiants du Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH), Alf-Egil Bogen et Vegard Wollan. Ces processeurs, en particulier utilisés par l’environnement Arduino, sont équipés de mémoires FLASH, RAM, et EEPROM.

Les fusibles ne sont pas effacés par la commande de réinitialisation (reset) SPI; ils sont modifiés par des commandes dédiées. Ils contrôlent certaines fonctionnalités de programmation telles que l'utilisation de la broche RESET ou du protocole SPI, ainsi que d'autres paramètres physiques relatifs aux horloges et tensions logiques. En l’absence de ROM, il n’est pas possible de désactiver définitivement les opérations d’écriture FLASH.

Cela implique la disponibilité de clés symétriques ou asymétriques, et la définition d'un système d'identité (basé sur des numéros de série ou des certificats par exemple) - Stockage Sécurisé, par exemple pour les secrets nécessaires aux communications, mais plus généralement pour des informations sensibles. - Intégrité des Nœuds, mécanismes d'isolation logicielle (par exemple multi processeurs pour la résistance aux malwares, SandBox pour l'intégrité du système d'exploitation), mise à jour/chargement de logiciels sécurisée (signature des logiciels), prévention détection des intrusions et comportements suspects, prévention des attaques par rebond. Principes de sécurité. Classiquement la sécurité s’appuie sur cinq concepts de base, l'identification, l'authentification, la confidentialité, l'intégrité, et la non répudiation.

C’est la garantie que les données échangées ne sont compréhensibles que pour les deux entités qui partagent un même secret souvent appelé association de sécurité (SA).

Intégrité L’intégrité des données (MAC, Message AuthentiCation). Le chiffrement évite les écoutes indiscrètes, mais il ne protège pas contre la modification des informations par un intervenant mal intentionné. Des fonctions à sens unique (encore dénommées empreintes) telles que MD5 (16 octets) ou SHA1 (20 octets), SHA2, SHA3 réalisent ce service. Le MAC peut être associé à une clé secrète, telle la procédure HMAC(Clé, Message), Keyed-Hashing for Message AuthentiCation. Le chiffrement et l'intégrité peuvent être combinés dans un seul algorithme AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data), par exemple AES-CCM, AES-GCM. Non-répudiation La non-répudiation.

Disponibilité On cite fréquemment un sixième attribut relatif à aux notions de sûreté de fonctionnement, disponibilité, et résilience du système. Au sujet de la confiance Remarquons également que la sécurité implique le partage de confiance entre les différents acteurs de la chaîne. Pour partager un secret il faut avoir confiance dans les capacités des parties concernées à ne pas le divulguer.

Mécanismes symétriques: mot de passe, pre-shared key, provisionning Nous divisons les méthodes symétriques en trois classes - Les mots de passe. Un mot de passe est une suite de caractères qui peut être facilement mémorisée par un être humain. Il ne s’agit pas d’un nombre aléatoire mais au contraire d’une concaténation de mots, de chiffres et de signes. De tels secrets peuvent être devinés à l’aide d’une attaque par dictionnaire, c’est à dire un programme utilisant une base de données pour la génération de ces valeurs. Ainsi les méthodes EAP-MSCHAPv2 ou LEAP reposent sur la clé NT, c’est à dire l’empreinte MD4 (soit 16 octets) d’un mot de passe. Dans les anciens systèmes UNIX la liste des empreintes des mots de passe est stockée dans le ficher /etc/passwd. Le fichier /etc/shadow lisible uniquement en mode root est aujourd’hui préféré. Un mot de passe est par exemple une chaîne d’au plus 8 caractères ASCII, convertie en une clé DES de 56 bits (8 x 7bits). La fonction crypt(key, salt) réalise dans ce cas 25 chiffrements DES consécutifs (avec une valeur initiale IV=0), dont chacun comporte une permutation choisie parmi 4096 possible (soit 12 bits, c’est le paramètre salt, deux caractères choisis parmi 64 valeurs possibles a-z A-Z 0-9 . /). D’autres algorithmes de génération d’empreinte sont supportés, tels que la fonction MD5. IV=0 Dans l’univers Microsoft la sécurité d’un ordinateur personnel est fortement corrélée au mot de passe de son utilisateur. Ce dernier n’est jamais stocké en clair dans la mémoire de la machine.

MSCHAPv2 est une extension du protocole précédent, le serveur d’authentification délivre un nombre aléatoire de 16 octets (AuthenticatorChallenge), le client calcule un nombre 8 octets à partir de cette valeur, d’un aléa (PeerChallenge) qu’il génère et du nom de l’utilisateur (login).

La procédure NTLM Hash stocke l'image MD4 (16 octets) du mot de passe. Des programmes tels que CAIN ou Windows Password Recovery réalisent des attaques par force brute, dictionnaire ou rainbow tables. - Les secrets partagés (PSK, Pre-Shared-Key). Il s’agit en fait d’un nombre aléatoire, dont la taille est l’ordre de 128 à 160 bits. Un cerveau humain éprouve beaucoup de difficultés à mémoriser ces informations. Le stockage sécurisé du secret est réalisé par exemple par le système d’exploitation d’un ordinateur personnel ou par une carte à puce. - Le mode provisioning. Dans les réseaux GSM, 3G, 4G, 5G une base de données centralisée (Host Location Register) gère les comptes utilisateurs, en particulier leur PSK. Afin d’éviter des interrogations fréquentes les méthodes d’authentification (A3/A8, Milenage) sont conçues de telle manière que le site central puisse produire des vecteurs d’authentification (triplets GSM ou quadruplets UMTS), réutilisables par des agents de confiance (tels que les Visitor Location Register par exemple). Mécanismes Asymétriques Ces procédures sont basées sur des algorithmes tels que ECC, RSA ou Diffie-Hellman. Le protocole SSL/TLS est généralement utilisé pour le transport de ces échanges. Les tunnels Ainsi que nous l’avons souligné précédemment les méthodes d’authentification basées sur des mots de passe, sont sujettes à des attaques par dictionnaire. Ainsi le protocole MSCHAP assure une protection jugée raisonnable dans des environnements sûrs (par exemple des intranets ou des connexions par modem), mais n’est plus adapté lors d’une mise en œuvre dans un milieu hostile, tel que IP sans fil, abritant potentiellement de nombreuses oreilles électroniques indiscrètes. Les tunnels, s’appuyant fréquemment sur la technologie SSL/TLS, protègent un dialogue d’authentification grâce au chiffrement des données échangées.

Les faiblesses du protocole IP Par nature un réseau est sensible au déni de service, au niveau physique (brouillage divers…) ou logique (destruction/modification des paquets ou des trames). Le protocole ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) réalise une correspondance entre une adresse MAC et une adresse IP. Dans l’attaque dite ARP spoofing l’attaquant forge une trame de réponse (ARP.response) erronée. Il en résulte un détournement du trafic IP. Un paquet IP comporte typiquement un en tête de 20 octets démuni d’attributs cryptographiques de sécurité. La confidentialité et l’intégrité des données transportées ne sont donc pas assurées. Le mécanisme de segmentation est difficilement analysable par les pare- feu. En effet, seul le premier segment IP contient l’entête du protocole supérieur transporté, par exemple TCP ou UDP. De même le réassemblage peut entraîner un problème de déni de service pour la machine de réception (la taille maximale d’un paquet IP est de 65535 octets et le temps de réception des fragments est indéterminé). La correspondance adresse IP nom de machine est typiquement réalisée par le protocole DNS qui n’offre aucun service d’authentification ou d’intégrité. Lorsqu’un pare-feu autorise les paquets ICMP, il s’expose à de possibles canaux cachés, utilisés par exemple pour dialoguer avec des chevaux de Troie, dont les informations sont transportées par des paquets ICMP.response. Le protocole TCP ne propose aucune authentification du serveur lors de l’ouverture d’une session (paquets SYN et ACK+SYN). Le SYN-Flooding est une technique d’attaque de déni de service qui consiste à générer en grand nombre de paquets TCP-SYN. L’analyse des ports TCP (en mode serveur) ouverts d’un nœud IP (port scan) repose sur la possibilité de forger librement des paquets TCP-SYN.

Au sujet des normes Critères Communs (CC) Les normes ISO 15408 dénommées Critères Communs visent à qualifier la sécurité de produits tels que microcontrôleurs sécurisés, cartes à puce ou firewalls. Elles sont organisées en trois parties, introduction (partie 1), exigences fonctionnelles de sécurité (partie 2) et exigences d’assurances de sécurité (partie 3). Une évaluation CC est une procédure qui décerne un EAL (Evaluation Assurance Level) selon un document de référence, la cible de sécurité (Security Target). La cible de sécurité liste les exigences fonctionnelles de sécurité (CC partie 2, par exemple identification et authentification - classe FIA) et les exigences d’assurance de qualité (CC partie 3, par exemple les tests – classe ATE) du produit, c’est-à-dire le TOE (Target Of Evaluation) dans la terminologie CC. Les exigences fonctionnelles et d’assurances sont classées selon une hiérarchie à trois niveaux: classe-famille-composants. De manière optionnelle le TOE peut être décrit dans un Protection Profile (ou PP) qui est commun à un ensemble de produits dont les fonctionnalités et les exigences de sécurité sont similaires.

Il peut s'installer au sein d'un autre logiciel, une bibliothèque ou dans le noyau d'un système d'exploitation. Les premiers rootkits sont apparus en 1994 sur Linux et SunOS4; en 1998, sous Windows, (Back Orifice) et en 2004 sous Mac OS (X, WeaponX5). Le buffer overflow Le buffer overflow consiste à modifier malicieusement la mémoire d’un programme, typiquement lors de l’écriture d’une information localisée dans un paramètre d’appel du programme, ou lors de l’écriture de données reçues via le réseau (c’est-à-dire à l’aide des bibliothèques de sockets). Le langage C utilise des chaines (char[]) de caractères dont la marque de fin est un octet nul. Les fonctions qui manipulent ces chaines (notées avec un préfixe s, par exemple strcpy,…), peuvent modifier une plage mémoire supérieure à la taille allouée par le concepteur du programme. Par exemple char name[12] ; char *information; // la marque de fin est un octet nul strcpy(name, information) ; Si la taille de information dépasse 12 octets, la mémoire allouée pour name est insuffisante, en conséquence une partie du contenu du pointeur information modifie la mémoire du programme de manière imprévue. Les effets espérés par les buffer overflow dans la pile d’exécution sont répartis en trois classes principales - La modification d’une variable mémoire, proche de la zone mémoire occupée par le buffer, par exemple pour l'exploitation de \"use-after-free vulnerabilities\". - la modification de l’adresse de retour du programme localisée dans la pile, le but étant l’exécution d’un code malveillant contenu dans un paramètre d’appel ou dans une information reçue via le réseau. - la modification d’un pointeur de fonction afin d’exécuter un code préalablement injecté. Les effets des buffer overflow dans la zone mémoire dite heap (ou tas) sont différents, car cette dernière est utilisée par les fonctions de type malloc réalisant les allocations dynamiques de mémoire.

Il existe un autre concept, l'architecture d'Harvard, dans lequel le code et les données sont stockés dans des mémoires distinctes; cette dernière approche est usuelle dans les environnements de type microcontrôleurs. Le format ELF définit cinq zones de mémoires virtuelles pour un programme, text pour le code, data pour les données initialisées, bss pour les données non initialisées, la pile (stack) et le tas (heap) qui est la zone mémoire restante intercalée entre pile et données. Le shellcode désigne un programme qui exécute un ensemble de commandes du shell. Il est possible d’exécuter un shell dans un programme, à l’aide d’un appel système spécifique; un code malicieux exploite cette fonctionnalité. Une attaque consiste dans ce cas à injecter un shellcode puis à l’exécuter via des techniques de buffers overflow. En 1988, un étudiant du MIT, Robert Tappan Morris, réalisa la première mise en œuvre offensive sur internet des techniques buffer overflow, nommée Morris worm. L'ouvrage52 \"Techniques de Hacking\", de Jon Erickson, détaille les techniques d'exploitation de buffer overflow et l'injection de code en particulier de Shell Code.

Principes de sécurité du système Android Android est un système d’exploitation crée par la société Android Inc. rachetée en 2005 par GOOGLE. Il est aujourd’hui largement déployé dans les mobiles. Le système Android s’appuie sur un noyau UNIX. L’image binaire du système nommée ROM, contient le noyau, les librairies natives, l’environnement de la Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM), le framework Java (JNI), et les applications. Une application Android comporte au plus quatre composants : l’activité, le service, le fournisseur de contenu et le receveur de broadcast. Les composants peuvent être déclarés publics ou privés. Les composants activités, services, et broadcast receivers, sont activés par un message asynchrone dénommé Intent. La sécurité android repose sur quatre piliers : - Les SANDBOXs Unix, associés aux processus - Les permissions. - La signature des applications - le chiffrement des fichiers. Un SANDBOX est un environnement logiciel qui contrôle les accès d’une application aux ressources d’un système informatique géré par un système d’exploitation. Pour le noyau Linux associé à Android, une application possède un user- id, un id de groupe et un id de groupe secondaire.

Chaque Application possède sa propre instance de Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM). Deux applications signées par une même clé privée peuvent partager un Sandbox identique. Le fichier Manifest.xml définit la structure d’une application, c’est-à-dire la liste de ses composants. Il contient également les demandes de permission d’accès aux ressources du mobile et décrit les Intents traités par l’application. C’est le gestionnaire de la politique de sécurité de l’application. Chaque application (.apk) doit être signée. Sous Eclipse on utilise les outils Keytool pour la génération de clés RSA dans un magasin de certificats (keystore), et Jarsigner pour la signature d’une application. Un certificat peut être auto-signé. Intégrité du code, obfuscation, TPM Certaines attaques intrusives sont liées à la possibilité de modifier le code d’un programme soit avant son exécution (modification du fichier exécutable) soit au cours de son exécution (point d’arrêts en mode debug, modification de certaines zones mémoire, pose de bretelles….). L’analyse d’un code lors de son exécution révèle la clé associée à un algorithme cryptographique. Cependant des techniques d’embrouillage de code (obfuscation) ou de WBC (White Box Cryptography) peuvent rendre ces attaques plus difficiles. Le groupe Trusted Computing Group (TCG) a défini une architecture sécurisée pour les ordinateurs personnels basés sur un module hardware sécurisé le TPM (Trusted Platform Module). Dans ce modèle l’intégrité du système (bibliothèques essentielles du système d’exploitation,…) est mesurée (integrity measurement) par une empreinte (SHA-1, 160 bits) stockée dans une puce de silicium résistante aux attaques (tamper resistant). L’accès à ce dispositif est contrôlé par des secrets partagés symétriques. Le TPM s’appuie sur un arbre de clés RSA, dont l’accès à chaque nœud est protégé par une clé symétrique.

Elle est conçue pour résister aux malwares présents au niveau du système d’exploitation. Un logiciel (ISV) crée une enclave à partir d’instructions dédiées SGX. L’identité de l’enclave (\"Enclave Identity\") est l’empreinte mémoire (hash) du logiciel et d’autres données. Le \"Sealing Identity\" est un certificat émis par le \"Sealing Authority\" pour certifier \"Enclave Identity\", ainsi que d’autres informations, par exemple un identifiant de produit.

Selon le classique paradigme de programmation procédurale, un programme est un ensemble de procédures, d'instructions, de branchements (jump), et de données. Le graphe CFG (Control Flow Graph) est une représentation de la structure des appels de procédures et des instructions de saut. Rendre un programme inintelligible consiste à rendre très difficile son analyse (reverse engineering) et en particulier l'extraction d'un CFG (voir par exemple la référence65). Un mécanisme deobfuscation (soit retrouver P à partir de O(P)) peut être un problème NP complet. Exemple de graphe CFG (Control Flow Graph) Les virus utilisent des techniques polymorphes ou métamorphes. - Dans le cas du polymorphisme, une clé modifiée à chaque instanciation du programme déchiffre des sous ensembles, qui sont chiffrés ultérieurement avec une nouvelle clé. -Dans le cas du métamorphisme, le programme polymorphe modifie tout ou partie de son code, qui est recompilé par la suite. L'obfuscation et la sécurité sont cependant deux notions distinctes. Ainsi après obfuscation, un algorithme cryptographique (DES par exemple) reste 64 A. Balakrishnan and C.

L'analyse de programme se décompose en deux classes fonctionnelles: - L'analyse statique qui examine le code source du programme afin d'en extraire un CFG et certaines informations (des clés cryptographiques par exemple).

En 2001 le célèbre article68 \"On the (Im)possibility of Obfuscating Programs\" a démontré que le concept de boite noire n'est pas universel, c'est à dire qu'il est toujours possible, quelque soit le procédé d'obfuscation, d'extraire de l'information de certaines fonctions, similaires à des procédures à sens unique (fonction de hash). Cependant le même article introduit la notion d'obfuscation non distinguable (Indistinguishability Obfuscation, iO) telle que les obfuscations iO(P1) et iO(P2) de deux variantes fonctionnellement équivalentes d'un programme (par exemple P1= !a + !b, et P2= !a.b) soient indiscernables. Selon une approche circuit, un algorithme (C1) conçu sous la forme canonique conjonctive (ensemble de AND de termes comprenant des OU de variable logique et de leur négation NOT) serait indiscernable d'une instanciation équivalente C2= iO(C1). Par la suite l'extraction d'information (soit l'obtention de la forme canonique C1 à partir de C2) est impossible en raison du problème bien connu SAT, qui est NP complet.

Son objectif70 est de réaliser l'obfuscation logicielle d'une clé associée à un algorithme cryptographique par exemple DES ou AES. Le code implémentant l'algorithme peut être cloné, mais l'extraction de la clé est présumée impossible. L'algorithme de chiffrement est transformé en un réseau de tables (lookup table) liées à la clé (S-Box modifiées). Une table S établit une relation entre un index (6 bits pour le DES) et une sortie (4 bits pour le DES), index = K exor E (K est une sous clé DES de 6 bits), Y = 6 6 6 6 4 S(index). Soit un index ’ = index exor K , on obtient une table Y = S(index ’). En 6 6 6 4 6 appliquant la relation index ’ exor E on retrouve index , et donc Y = S(index ’ exor 6 6 6 4 6 E ). Le code est par la suite embrouillé selon des techniques d'obfuscation. 6 Les implémentations DES et AES en white box ont été cassées71 par des attaques dites DCA (Differential Computation Analysis).

Intégrité physique Les implants matériels Un implant est une puce (chip) insérée dans un système électronique, dans le but de réaliser des fonctions malicieuses. Le 8 octobre 2018 la revue Bloomberg Business week a publié un article intitulé \"The Big Hack: How China Used a Tiny Chip to Infiltrate U.S. Companies\", lequel s’est avéré par la suite totalement infondé. L’article décrit une puce électronique (un implant) de la taille d’une pointe de crayon, soudée sur une carte mère destinée à des environnements cloud, et embarquant des ressources réseau Cependant en 2020 lors de la conférence CS3sthlm73 le chercheur Monta Elkins a présenté dans sa communication \"Nation- State Supply Chain Attacks for Dummies and You Too\" un implant basé sur le processeur ATTINY85 (8Ko FLASH, 512 octets EEPROM, 512-octets SRAM,). Ce boitier de petite taille (4x4x0.8mm) monté sur un module (DigiSpark) coute 1$ il est programmable avec l’IDE Arduino. L’implant est soudé sur la carte mère du routeur CISCO ASA5505. Le principe de l’attaque consiste à injecter lors du boot, des commandes sur l’interface série disponible pour l’administration du dispositif. Le micro logiciel crée un compte SSH permettant l’accès au routeur à distance et signale cette opportunité par une série de ping sur un serveur de l’attaquant. D’autres idées d’implant visent les claviers, par exemple le projet Haunted USB Cable74) (2010) utilise une puce ATTINY45 insérée dans une prise USB, qui réalise l’émulation d’un clavier USB HID (Human Interface Device).

En 2016 le projet75 a adapté le micro logiciel Haunted USB pour un processeur ATTINY85. La même année un autre projet76 a développé une variante logicielle qui injecte une série de caractères après trois pressions de la touche CapsLocks. Les claviers sont équipés de trois voyants indiquant l’activation des modes scroll lock, caps lock et insert. Le système d’exploitation envoie des messages USB HID pour synchroniser les affichages de plusieurs claviers. La séquence d’échange est la suivante: 1) la touche caps lock est pressée; 2) le micro logiciel du clavier notifie cet évènement dans un \"input report\"; 3) le PC diffuse un message \"output report\" pour l’activation de la LED correspondante; 4) le micrologiciel active la LED. Sous Windows des API dédiées permettent la gestion des différents modes d’un clavier. Il est donc possible d’établir un canal caché avec un malware HID USB. Certains modules Arduino, par exemple basés sur le processeur ATMEGA32u4 supportent des librairies HID réalisant des interfaces clavier et souris. L’ajout d’un SoC de communication, tel que Bluetooth ou Wi-Fi, permet d’injecter des messages indiquant le déplacement du curseur ou la frappe de touche. Typiquement l’attaque consiste à démarrer un shell pour exécuter des commandes. Les relais Les attaques par relais (Relay Attack) s’appuient sur une technique de type MIM (Man In the Middle) dont le but est d’étendre la distance de fonctionnement, et/ou de transmettre partiellement les informations reçues. Par exemple on peut relayer des signaux radio; des attaques SARA (Signal Amplification Relay Attacks) sont été constatées pour le vol de voiture équipées de systèmes RKS (Remote Keyless System). Une clé électronique détecte en permanence les signaux émis à courte portée par les véhicules, qui sont déverrouillés au terme d’un échange d’authentification. 75 https://github.com/whiteneon/haunted-usb-1.0 76 https://github.com/Uxio0/usbAspKeyboard Pascal Urien – Télécom Paris– Introduction à la Cyber Sécurité"}

Selon le même principe, des attaques sont possibles entre un terminal de paiement et une carte bancaire sans contact, au moyen d’un relais des commandes ISO7816, dites APDUs. En 2010 une équipe de chercheurs78 de l’Université College London et de l’université de Cambridge ont démontré une faille de sécurité dans le protocole EMV. L’évènement \"Code PIN non renseigné\" n’est pas mémorisé dans le cryptogramme de paiement, ce qui rend possible une attaque par relais.

Supposons un algorithme cryptographique dont le calcul se décompose en p étages. Chaque étage k (k étant compris entre 0 et p-1) prend comme argument d’entrée une valeur d'entré Mk,i et calcule la valeur de sortie Mk+1,i.

Plusieurs unités exécutent les instructions dont les résultats sont par la suite écrits dans une mémoire cache. L'exécution spéculative (Speculative Execution) est une technique utilisée par les processeurs performants qui consiste à prédire un chemin d'exécution probable. Le résultat d'une instruction de test est évalué, et en cas d'échec de cette prédiction, le processeur rétablit le contexte antérieur correct, ce qui ralentit le temps de traitement.

Le rapport souligne également la possibilité d’extraction d’informations à partir d’un trou de sécurité dans une application cliente de base de données multi parties (multi-tenant). 2) La perte de données. La perte de données peut résulter de problèmes matériels du fournisseur de Cloud, de malveillance (vol de mot de passe, intrusion…) ou de sinistres divers (incendie, inondation, tempêtes,…). 3) Détournement de comptes. En avril 2010, une faille de type Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) a permis à des hackers de récupérer des identifiants de compte Amazon. En 2009, le botnet Zeus s’est propagé sur de nombreux systèmes Amazon. 4) Interfaces et APIs non sécurisés. L’accès aux ressources du cloud implique un contrôle d’accès et des politiques de sécurité basés sur des identifiants.

Elle se produit lorsqu'une donnée non fiable est envoyée à un interpréteur, en tant qu'élément d'une commande ou d'une requête. A2 – Violation de Gestion d'Authentification et de Session. Les fonctions applicatives relatives à l'authentification et la gestion de session ne sont souvent pas mises en œuvre correctement. Elles permettent aux attaquants de compromettre les mots de passe, clés, jetons de session, ou d'exploiter d'autres failles d'implémentation afin de s'approprier les identités d'autres utilisateurs. A3 – Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Les failles XSS se produisent lorsqu'une application accepte des données non fiables et les envoie à un browser web sans validation appropriée. XSS permet à des attaquants d'exécuter un script dans le navigateur de la victime afin de détourner des sessions utilisateur, de modifier des sites web, ou rediriger l'utilisateur vers des sites malveillants. A4 – Références directes non sécurisées à un objet. Une référence directe à un objet se produit quand un développeur expose une référence d'un objet interne, tel que fichier, dossier, enregistrement de base de données, ou clé de base de données. Sans un contrôle d'accès ou autre protection, les attaquants peuvent manipuler ces références pour accéder à des données non autorisées. A5 – Mauvaise configuration Sécurité. Une sécurité pertinente implique une configuration sécurisée définie et déployée pour les applications, contextes, serveurs d'application, serveurs web, serveurs de base de données et la plateformes. Tous ces paramètres doivent être définis, mis en œuvre et maintenus, car beaucoup ne sont pas activés par défaut. Cela implique de tenir tous les logiciels à jour.

Les données sensibles nécessitent une protection supplémentaire, par exemple un chiffrement, ainsi que des précautions particulières lors des échanges avec le navigateur. A7 – Manque de contrôle d’accès au niveau fonctionnel. Pratiquement toutes les applications web vérifient les droits d'accès avant de rendre une fonction visible dans l'interface utilisateur. Cependant, les applications doivent effectuer les mêmes vérifications de contrôle d'accès sur le serveur lors de l'accès à chaque fonction. Si les demandes ne sont pas vérifiées, les attaquants seront en mesure de forger des demandes afin d'accéder à une fonction non autorisée. A8 - Falsification de requête inter-site (CSRF). Une attaque CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) force le navigateur d'une victime authentifiée à envoyer une requête HTTP forgée, comprenant le cookie de session de la victime ainsi que toute autre information automatiquement inclue, à une application web vulnérable. Ceci permet à l'attaquant de forcer le navigateur de la victime, à générer des requêtes dont l'application vulnérable pense qu'elles émanent légitimement de la victime. A9 - Utilisation de composants avec des vulnérabilités connues. Les composants vulnérables, tels que bibliothèques, contextes et autres modules logiciels fonctionnent presque toujours avec des privilèges maximum. Ainsi, si exploités, ils peuvent causer des pertes de données sérieuses ou une prise de contrôle du serveur. Les applications utilisant ces composants vulnérables peuvent compromettre leurs défenses et permettre une série d'attaques et d'impacts potentiels. A10 – Redirections et renvois non validés. Les applications web réorientent et redirigent fréquemment les utilisateurs vers d'autres pages et sites internet, et utilisent des données non fiables pour déterminer les pages de destination. Sans validation appropriée, les attaquants peuvent réorienter les victimes vers des sites de phishing ou de malware, ou utiliser les renvois pour accéder à des pages non autorisées.

Cette faiblesse provient du clivage logiciel des protocoles HTTP et TLS.

Vue ses aboutissements et la nécessité de faire communiquer les différentes services d’une entreprise ; l’informatique est devenu non seulement un monde à part avec son propre vocabulaire qui pris des ailes avec le temps mais également l‘informatique est de plus en plus obligatoire. La nécessité d'aller plus vite et d'être de plus en plus pointu dans le traitement de l'information a favorisé l'introduction de l'informatique dans tous les domaines d'activités de la vie. Aucun domaine n'échappe aux jours d’aujourd’hui à cette révolution technologique, qui au fil des jours s'affiche comme un outil indispensable de travail. Le besoin de répartition et de disponibilité de l'information à tous les postes des entreprises a entraîné l'émergence et la multiplication des réseaux locaux qui entraînent le besoin d'interconnexion. Raison pour laquelle un nouveau challenge s'offre aux professionnels de l'informatique : celui d'interconnecter les réseaux locaux entre eux afin que l'emplacement géographique ne soit plus un handicap pour l'accès aux informations. Par ailleurs, cette évolution a suscité une révolution de telle manière que les informations circulent d’un bout à l’autre du monde en temps record comme si nous habitons tous un même endroit. Ainsi, le monde est devenu un petit village planétaire. D’où, la nécessité de mobilisation des efforts et ressources pour la mise en place des systèmes adéquats afin de rendre disponible et accessible les informations par tous, à n’importe quel moment et à n’importe quel point du globe terrestre. En effet, grâce aux Nouvelles Technologies de l’Information et de la Communication (NTIC) ; les liens entre les entreprises deviennent de plus en plus étroits et les métiers se transforment. Ainsi, le monde du travail devient de plus en plus petit grâce aux rapprochements issus de ces derniers.

Historique de l’informatique] 6 CHAPITRE I. GENERALITES SUR L’INFORMATIQUE I.1. Définition Contrairement à la plupart des disciplines scientifiques, il n’existe pas d’équivalent anglais du terme français informatique. Ce terme revêt plutôt deux sens chez les anglophones : − Electronic Data Processing (traitement électronique de données), met l’accent sur l’objet manipulé ; il s‘agit du côté pratique ; − Computer Science (science de l’ordinateur), met en évidence la machine qui permet la manipulation de l’information. C’est un aspect théorique. Le mot « Informatique »1 a été proposé officiellement par l’ingénieur français Philippe DREYFUS en 1962 (normalisé en 1966), Cependant, une controverse relate que le mot « informatique » a été pour la première fois prononcé par l’ingénieur allemand KARL STEINBUCH en 1957. Par ailleurs, En juillet 1968 le mot fût repris dans le discours d'un ministre allemand, M. STOLTENBERG, sous la forme germanisée « informatik ». De fil en aiguille le mot s'est rapidement répandu dans plusieurs pays d'Europe : « informática » en Espagne et au Portugal ; « informatica » en Hollande et en Italie ; « informatik » en Norvège ; « informatika » en Hongrie, Russie et Slovaquie. Les anglo-saxons et américains préfèrent généralement le terme « computer science – science des ordinateurs » mais le terme « informatics » est parfois usité en Grande-Bretagne et certains pays francophones. Par ailleurs, Le terme « informaticien » est donc un terme générique désignant une personne dont le travail est en grande partie lié à l'informatique. L’informatique est un mot valise composé de deux concepts : Information et Automatique. Ainsi donc, l’informatique peut être considérée comme une automatisation de l'information, ou plus exactement un traitement automatique de l'information. L'information désigne ici tout ce qui peut être traité par une machine (textes, nombres, images, sons, vidéos...). L'outil utilisé pour traiter l'information de manière automatique s'appelle un ordinateur. 1 En 1957, Ingénieur allemand KARL STEINBUCH crée le terme « Informatik » pour son essai intitulé « Informatik: Automatische Informationsverarbeitung », pouvant être rendu en français par « Informatique : traitement automatique de l'information » … En mars 1962, Ingénieur français Philippe Dreyfus, ancien directeur"}

Selon I.B.M (International Business Machine), « l‘informatique est définie comme étant l‘ensemble de disciplines techniques et scientifiques spécialement applicables à la conception et à l‘utilisation des machines de traitement de l‘information et l’ordinateur est l’outil privilégié ». Dans le contexte de ce cours, « l’informatique est la science du stockage, du traitement et de la transmission de l’information ». Et donc, elle désigne trois concepts : une science, un art et une technique. − Elle est une science quand elle est orientée vers la recherche de la vérité. Ici, elle est la science renfermant les normes et techniques de traitement de l’information. Ces normes et techniques sont de règles de jeu qui permettent à l’informatique d’automatiser l’information2. Pour arriver à son objectif ; l‘informatique utilise un outil appelé « l‘ordinateur ». − Elle est une technique dans la mesure où c‘est une application de l’électronique. − Elle est un art parce qu’elle permet à l’esprit humain à se révéler c.à.d. le génie humain.

Les développements des siècles précédents ont évolué vers la discipline que nous connaissons aujourd'hui sous le nom d'informatique. Cette progression, des inventions mécaniques et des théories mathématiques vers les concepts et les machines informatiques modernes, a conduit au développement d'un domaine académique majeur, à un progrès technologique spectaculaire à travers le monde occidental et à la base d'un commerce et d'une culture mondiale massive.

LEIBNIZ inventa aussi le système binaire, système de numération qui sera approprié aux futurs ordinateurs. − En 1728, l’ingénieur Français FALCON construisit une commande de métier à tisser à l’aide d’une planchette de bois muni de trous. Il s’agit de la première machine capable d’exécuter un programme. − En 1806, Joseph Marie JACQUARD perfectionne le système de FALCON en remplaçant les planches par des cartes perforées. − En 1812, le mathématicien anglais Charles BABBAGE (1792-1871) conçoit une machine différentielle et appareil mécanique pouvant effectuer des calculs mathématiques simples avec une précision pouvant atteindre 31 chiffres. Il fut abandonné cette construction pour des raisons financières. Plus tard, il conçoit une machine analytique à cartes perforées afin d’effectuer des calculs plus compliqués. Cette réflexion sur la mécanisation du calcul annonce l’informatique. − En 1936, Alan Turing infirme la théorie de Kurt GODEL et démontre qu’on ne peut pas tout calculer de manière automatique. Il imagine pour sa démonstration un outil qui inspire encore le fonctionnement de nos ordinateurs.

Système informatique et Système d’information I.4.1. Information Une « information » est tout élément de connaissance représentés par des signes et symboles de manière conventionnelle pour être conservé, traité ou communiqué. En informatique de gestion, une « information » est la représentation subjective d’un fait, d’une situation, d’un évènement sous forme conventionnelle qui en assure la permanence et facilite le maniement ainsi que la transformation. Elle est l‘ensemble de l‘entité, l‘attribut ainsi que les valeurs. I.4.2. Données Par contre, Une « donnée » est une unité élémentaire dans le processus de prise de décision. C'est un renseignement sur un sujet donné. Elle peut être comprise comme un fait, une notion ou une instruction représentée sous forme conventionnelle convenant à la communication, à l‘interprétation, ou à un traitement par l‘homme ou par des moyens automatiques. La donnée peut être écrite ou audible En informatique, le concept information est compris comme l‘ensemble de données pouvant être traitées par un système informatique. Autrement dit, c’est la représentation des informations au moyen d’un ordinateur. I.4.3. Traitement de l’information En informatique, traiter l‘information signifie : − Recueillir l’information : On dispose de deux grandes sources d‘alimentation en informations : les sources internes et les sources externes. Face à ces sources d‘information le système d‘information remplit les tâches d‘écoute, d‘analyse et de saisie.

Le système d‘information met en œuvre des moyens techniques et organisationnels (méthodes d‘archivage, de protection contre le piratage ou la destruction, etc.). Aujourd‘hui la mémorisation des informations se fait au moyen de deux techniques principales : les fichiers et les bases de données. − Exploiter l’information : Une fois mémorisée, l‘information, on peut appliquer à l‘information tout une série d‘opérations. Ces opérations de traitement consistent à :  Consulter les informations : les rechercher, les sélectionner, …  Organiser les informations : les trier, les fusionner, les partitionner, …  Mettre à jour les informations : les modifier (sur la forme et le contenu), les supprimer, etc.  Produire de nouvelles informations : informations calculées (suite à de calculs arithmétiques ou de calculs logiques) cumuls, etc. − Diffuser l’information : La diffusion consiste à mettre à la disposition de ceux qui en ont besoin, au moment où ils en ont besoin et sous une forme directement exploitable, l‘ensemble des informations qui leur permettront d‘assurer leurs activités. Les supports de cette diffusion sont soit le support oral, le support papier, le support électronique ou magnétique I.4.4.

Système d’information A ne pas confondre avec système informatique, le SI d‘entreprise est l‘ensemble d‘informations qui circulent dans l‘entreprise et les moyens mis en œuvre pour les gérer. Toutes les informations, quelle que soit leur forme, font partie du système d ‘information. Nous attendons par gérer, le recueil, l‘exploitation, le stockage et la diffusion des informations. Il apparaît, à la lumière de cette définition, que l‘information est un des éléments capitaux constituant les préoccupations d‘un système d‘information. Elle mérite donc l‘attention des chercheurs en informatique. Ainsi donc, Il existe plusieurs typologies de SI, cependant nous nous intéressons à distinguer le SI automatisé du SI manuel. − Le SI manuel est celui dont les opérations sur les informations sont manuelles et ne font pas recours aux machines. − Semi-automatique fait allusion à la saisie, à la consultation ou visualisation, à la mise à jour des informations. Dans ce cas les interventions de l‘homme et de la machine sont conjointes. On parle alors de traitement interactif ou conversationnel où les opérations sont assurées grâce à un dialogue entre l’homme et la machine. − Le SI automatisé, les opérations les plus significatives sur les informations sont assurées par des machines électroniques programmables effectuant des traitements automatiques. L‘intervention humaine se limite à une phase de préparation du travail des machines. Exemple : gestion comptable réalisée grâce à un progiciel spécifique. Quand on parle de SI automatisé, il faut nuancer l‘importance du rôle joué par la machine et la place de l‘homme. Dans ce SI, le processus automatique ainsi que le processus semi-automatique se côtoient. Automatique fait allusion aux calculs répétitifs, calculs complexes, mémorisation des données, édition des documents comptables, des états de sorties, etc. I.5.

Introduction] 13 La principale différence entre les langages informatiques et les langues naturelles réside dans l’absence d’ambiguïté : alors que certaines phrases du français peuvent être interprétées différemment par différents auditeurs, tous seront d’accord pour dire ce que fait un programme donné. Le langage utilisé par le processeur, c'est-à-dire les données telles qu'elles lui arrivent, sont appelées langage machine. Il s'agit d'une suite de 0 et de 1 (dit binaire). Toutefois le langage machine n'est pas compréhensible facilement par l'humain. Ainsi il est plus pratique de trouver un langage intermédiaire, compréhensible par l'homme, qui sera ensuite transformé en langage machine pour être exploitable par le processeur. L'assembleur est le premier langage informatique qui ait été utilisé. Celui- ci est encore très proche du langage machine mais il permet déjà d'être plus compréhensible. Toutefois un tel langage est tellement proche du langage machine qui dépend étroitement du type de processeur utilisé (chaque type de processeur peut avoir son propre langage machine). Ainsi un programme développé pour une machine ne pourra pas être porté sur un autre type de machine (on désigne par le terme « portable », un programme qui peut être utilisé sur un grand nombre de machines). Pour pouvoir l'utiliser sur une autre machine il faudra alors parfois réécrire entièrement le programme. Un langage informatique a donc plusieurs avantages : − Il est plus facilement compréhensible que le langage machine ; − Il permet une plus grande portabilité, c'est-à-dire une plus grande facilité d'adaptation sur des machines de types différents. C’est pour répondre aux problèmes de l’assembleur qu’ont été développé dès les années 50 des langages de plus haut niveau.

Introduction L‘ordinateur a été appelé « outil intelligent », car il augmente notre habileté à exécuter des tâches exigeant l‘activité mentale. Plus encore, il le fait avec une rapidité extraordinaire. La clé de l‘utilisation effective à bon escient de l‘ordinateur comme un outil est de connaître ce qu‘il est, comment il fonctionne et comment l‘utiliser. Par ailleurs, cette agilité est rendu possible grâce à l’informatique (INFORMAtion automaTIQUE) consiste à rassembler et transformer diverses informations à l’aide d’un (ou plusieurs) ordinateur(s) afin d’obtenir la solution d’un problème : − Les informations utiles doivent être disponibles pour l’ordinateur, donc être collectées, clairement codifiées, saisies et enregistrées sur un support informatique (une « mémoire ») ; − Le problème à résoudre doit avoir été analysé avec précision, la façon d’en obtenir la solution doit avoir été traduite sous la forme d’un programme. L’ordinateur est une machine électronique qui inclue des dispositifs optiques, électromécaniques ou électromagnétiques et dont le fonctionnement est guidé par des programmes réalisés par l’homme : − Un ordinateur est inerte en l’absence d’alimentation électrique ou de programme ; − Son « QI » (quotient intellectuel) est NUL et il est incapable d’initiative ; − L’ordinateur est un outil complexe. Il est encore nécessaire d’en connaître le fonctionnement pour bien l’utiliser. L’ordinateur fonctionne aujourd’hui comme à ses débuts. C’est une machine qui travaille sur des données binaires (représentées symboliquement par des suites de 0 et de 1) de manière séquentielle et au rythme d’une horloge interne : − Dans l’ordinateur, toute information est représentée par une suite de bits. Un bit (abréviation de BInary digiT) représente une valeur choisie parmi deux possibilités (symbolisées par 0 et 1, mais concrétisées par un phénomène physique à deux état stables comme « allumé-éteint », « 0 volts – 3 volts », « aimantation nord ou sud », « courant passant ou bloqué », etc. …) ; − À chaque « top » d’horloge, il y a modification d’une série de bits représentant les données en cours de traitement ; Prof. Dr. YENDE RAPHAEL Grevisse, PhD.

Définition et contexte d’étude Un ordinateur est un ensemble de circuits électroniques permettant de manipuler des données sous forme binaire, c'est-à-dire sous forme de bits. Le mot « ordinateur » provient de la société IBM France. François Girard, alors responsable du service promotion générale publicité de l'entreprise IBM France, eut l'idée de consulter son ancien professeur de lettres à Paris, afin de lui demander de proposer un mot caractérisant le mieux possible ce que l'on appelait vulgairement un « calculateur » (traduction littérale du mot anglais « computer »). Ainsi, Jacques Perret, agrégé de lettres, alors professeur de philologie latine à la Sorbonne, proposa le 16 avril 1955 le mot « Ordinateur » en précisant que le mot « Ordinateur » était un adjectif provenant d‘Emile Littré (Lexicographe Français du 19ème siècle) signifiant « Dieux mettant de l'ordre dans le monde ». Ainsi, il expliqua que le concept de « mise en ordre » était tout à fait adapté. Prof. Dr. YENDE RAPHAEL Grevisse, PhD. Cours d’Informatique Générale / UNIBAS"}

Générations des ordinateurs] 17 L’ordinateur n’a ni forme ni couleur. Si vous consultez un dictionnaire imprimé avant 1940, vous serez surpris de trouver que l‘ordinateur est défini comme une personne” effectuant des calculs. En outre, bien que d‘autres machines font des calculs, elles n‘ont jamais été appelées des ordinateurs mais plutôt des calculatrices. La définition du terme « ordinateur » commença à changer à partir de 1940 lorsque le premier « electronic computing devise » fut développé aux USA planifié par JOHN VON NEWMAN qui est le premier à utiliser les mot « automatic computing system » raccourci plus tard à « computer » ou « computer system ». Ainsi, pour John Von Newman, l’ordinateur est une machine qui accepte les entrées, stocke les résultats du traitement et donne des sorties. L‘ordinateur exécute toutes ces opérations non à cause d‘une intelligence super humaine, mais par ce qu‘il peut exécuter des opérations extrêmement simples avec précision et rapidement selon un processus ou programme qui est dicté par l‘homme (le programmeur). D‘où, d‘une intelligence par procuration, l‘ordinateur ne peut calculer ou prendre des décisions logiques seulement lorsqu‘il a reçu des consignes qu‘il revient à l‘homme de définir. En français, ce néologisme fut créé en 1956 par Jacques Perret sur proposition d‘IBM pour désigner un calculateur (dans certaines traductions de l‘anglais on lira parfois le mot calculateur pour désigner un ordinateur) et désigne une machine programmable capable d‘effectuer un traitement de l‘information. Un ordinateur est donc constitué au minimum de : − Une unité centrale (pour l‘exécution des programmes) ; − Une mémoire centrale (pour le stockage des données et des logiciels en cours d‘exécution) ; Prof. Dr. YENDE RAPHAEL Grevisse, PhD.

Si nous inscrivons l‘ordinateur dans l‘ensemble de tous les outils électroniques, il convient de l‘en différencier en lui donnant ses caractéristiques les plus particulières. Il est caractérisé par : − La rapidité et exactitude : Pour calculer la moyenne de trois nombres jusqu‘à sept chiffres après la virgule, un homme mettra plus d‘une minute, tandis que l‘ordinateur peut calculer la moyenne de plus de 100 millions en moins de deux secondes. Plus encore l‘ordinateur sera correct et exact. − La capacité la souplesse : Ceci se dit du volume des données que peut stocker la mémoire d‘un ordinateur. Un ordinateur peut stocker et savoir restituer tous les répertoires de toutes les lignes téléphoniques d‘une ville ou d‘un pays. − L’adaptabilité : l‘ordinateur s‘adapte à presque tous les besoins de l‘utilisateur pourvu que ce dernier sache comment s‘y prendre. Un même ordinateur peut être utilisé pour : imprimer les états financiers d‘une banque, dessiner les traits d‘un croquis, calculer les paris impairs, calculer des orbites, des satellites, calculer les statistiques d‘une population, contrôler une guerre, surveiller des malades à l‘hôpital, combiner les aspirations des amoureux, assurer la communication, … II.3. Fonctions d'un ordinateur Un ordinateur possède trois grandes catégories de fonctions : Calculer ; Gérer des données et Communication. − Calculer : C'est la tâche pour laquelle l'ordinateur a été conçu au départ. D'ailleurs, le nom anglais de l'ordinateur, « computer », signifie en français « calculateur ». La fonction de calcul d'un ordinateur ne se limite pas à l'utilisation de la calculette, d'un tableur ou à l'exécution de programmes de calculs scientifiques. Il y a en fait du calcul dans toutes les opérations que réalise un ordinateur :  L'affichage d'une page web ou d'un document réalisé avec un traitement de texte ;  Le codage et le décodage des informations stockées dans les fichiers ;  La gestion des communications avec d'autres ordinateurs sur un réseau...

Cette opération, appelée « codage de l'information », est l'une des nombreuses opérations de calcul nécessaires au fonctionnement des différents programmes. − Gérer des données : Lorsque vous utilisez un ordinateur, vous avez souvent besoin de conserver les résultats de votre travail. C'est par exemple le cas si vous rédigez votre CV, utilisez un outil de messagerie ou travaillez sur un logiciel de retouche d'image. Dans toutes ces situations, une fois votre travail terminé, vous souhaitez que l'ordinateur puisse enregistrer les données correspondantes, et vous les restituer ultérieurement. Quels que soient les éléments de l'ordinateur où ce stockage aura lieu, il est nécessaire de mettre en forme ces données et de les organiser, pour que vous puissiez les retrouver au milieu de l'ensemble des autres données également stockées au même endroit. − Communiquer : Un ordinateur peut communiquer soit avec un utilisateur, soit avec un autre ordinateur. La fonction de communication ne consiste donc pas uniquement à échanger des informations sur Internet. Cette utilisation de l‘ordinateur est d‘ailleurs la plus récente, puisqu‘elle ne s‘est réellement développée qu‘avec l‘essor du Web, dans les années 1990. En revanche, quelle que soit la tâche que vous réalisez avec votre ordinateur, vous passez votre temps à interagir avec lui, soit pour lui donner des ordres, soit pour prendre connaissance des résultats. Dans ce cadre, un grand nombre d‘éléments, matériels et logiciels, font partie de l’interface homme-machine, qui permet la communication entre l‘utilisateur et l‘ordinateur.

Parmi eux, citons John ATANASOFF (université de l’IOWA) et George STIBITZ (Bell Laboratories), qui tous deux adoptèrent le système binaire. II.4.2. Première Génération : le tube à vide (1945-1955) Le tube à vide est une ampoule vidée d’air contenant plusieurs électrodes entre lesquelles apparaît, sous certaines conditions, un courant d’électrons. Exemple : diode à vide. En 1943, COLOSSUS le premier calculateur électronique numérique est construit, et littéralement porté par Alan TURING pour permettre le décryptage des messages radios transmis par les forces de l’axe, et codés au moyen de la fameuse machine ENIGMA (elle permettait de coder des informations). Dans l’optique de réglage des tirs d’artillerie, en 1943 l’armée américaine accepta de financer les travaux de John Presper ECKERT et John MAUCHLY qui aboutirent à la réalisation d’une machine pour le moins célèbre : l’ENIAC. Celle-ci (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) était capable de 5.000 opérations arithmétiques à la seconde et était 1.000 fois rapide que le mark I. Pour fonctionner, il fallait une puissance électrique de près de 200Kw, comportait 19.000 lampes, pesait 30 tonnes et occupait un espace de 160 m2 au sol. Un jour, en 1947, l’ENIAC tomba en panne sans que ses constructeurs ne sachent pourquoi. Après exploration, on constata qu’un insecte s’était logé dans un relais ; le technicien qui a fait la découverte s’est écrié : « There is a bug in the machine ». Le nom « bug » est resté pour désigner une « erreur de matériel ou de programmation ». II.4.3.

C’est un dispositif électronique pouvant remplir les fonctions d’un amplificateur, d’un commutateur ou d’un oscillateur, dans les télécommunications, le contrôle et les systèmes. Il s’agit d’un élément semi- conducteur (rend possible le passage du courant, c’est un circuit logique, un amplificateur, stabilisateur de tension, modulateur du signal, etc.). Il ressemble à un petit sandwich qui contient de la matière capable de conduire l’électricité à un voltage donné. Avec ce dispositif, les ordinateurs deviennent plus petits et plus performants. Ci-dessus, l’image de quelques modèles de transistors. II.4.4. Troisième génération : le circuit intégré (1965-1980) Le circuit intégré, appelé aussi puce électronique, est une petite pastille de silicium sur laquelle sont gravés de nombreux composants électroniques (transistors, résistances …). Les circuits intégrés sont donc l’association de plusieurs transistors. En 1959, Jack St. Clair KILBY (Texas Instruments) et Robert NOYLE inventèrent les circuits intégrés. Au cours de cette période, les microprocesseurs font leur apparition (tel est le 8080 d’Intel). Les premières familles d’ordinateurs apparaissent (IBM 360) et avec elles le concept de compatibilité descendante (conservation du logiciel). Ci-dessus, l’image des circuits intégrés. II.4.5.

Elle apparaît lorsque le développement des premiers ordinateurs donne à penser qu’ils seront rapidement capables de simuler la pensée. Le mathématicien britannique Alan Mathison TURING propose ainsi, en 1950, un test (appelé test de Turing) permettant d’évaluer l’intelligence d’une machine : un ordinateur est qualifié d’intelligent si, en communiquant avec lui à distance et par écrit, un utilisateur ne peut deviner s’il s’agit ou non d’un être humain. Les comportements humains ne sont rien d'autre que le résultat d'un calcul portant sur des données plus ou moins complexes et tout calcul peut être simulé par une machine de TURING universelle.

Architecture matérielle] 23 2. Classification moderne Cette classification est plutôt basée sur la taille et la forme de l’ordinateur ainsi sa capacité de puissance de calculs. Dans cette catégorie, on peut citer : − Les micro-ordinateurs : Un micro-ordinateur est un ordinateur construit autour d’un microprocesseur. Les micro-ordinateurs ont été conçus au début des années 1970, sous l’impulsion des microprocesseurs. Les micro- ordinateurs sont aujourd’hui utilisés par les particuliers et les industriels en raison de leur faible coût, de leur très bon apport en puissance de traitement/prix et de leur facilité d’emploi. On distingue :  Les ordinateurs de bureau (appelés aussi « Desktop ») sont composés d’un boîtier renfermant les principaux composants et permettant de raccorder les différents dispositifs externes.  Les ordinateurs portables (« laptop ») sont composés d’un boîtier intégrant un écran dépliable, un clavier et un grand nombre des dispositifs incorporés.  Les organiseurs, appelés encore « Handheld » ou « PDA » (Personnal Digital Assistant) sont des ordinateurs de poche proposant des fonctionnalités liées à l’organisation personnelle. − Les stations de travail : Une station de travail est un micro-ordinateur haut de gamme disposant d’outils graphiques et des communications avancées qui en font l’outil idéal pour accomplir des tâches nécessitant à la fois des bonnes capacités de stockage et de puissance de calcul. Il s’agit en fait d’un ordinateur puissant mis à la disposition d’un utilisateur et relié à un réseau. − Les gros ordinateurs ou Mainframes : Un gros ordinateur est une machine conçue selon la philosophie des ordinateurs de la 1ère génération fondée sur un informatique centralisé. Ces genres de machines sont capables de répondre aux besoins des grandes entreprises commerciales, de différentes institutions gouvernementales ou militaires et des établissements de recherche scientifiques. Les gros ordinateurs adaptés tout particulièrement aux calculs scientifiques sont appelés « super calculateurs ».

De nos jours, les connecteurs PS/2, ont été systématiquement remplacés par des claviers avec un connecteur USB, voire des claviers sans fils. Le clavier comporte plusieurs parties notamment le pavé numérique (qui permet la saisie des chiffres et d’effectuer des calculs dans un tableur) ; les flèches de direction (permettant le déplacement dans le texte) ; les touches alphanumériques (où nous retrouvons les lettres de l’alphabet, les chiffres et les ponctuations) ; les touches de fonction (sont des raccourcis qui permettent d’accéder à des fonctions sans passer par les menus) ; les voyants lumineux ; la partie multimédia (pour les claviers récents). 2.

Architecture matérielle] 27 La première souris a été inventée et mise au point par Douglas Carle ENGELBART : il s'agissait d'une souris en bois contenant deux disques perpendiculaires et relié à l'ordinateur par une paire de fils torsadés. La souris est généralement branchée à l'arrière de l'unité centrale, sur la carte-mère, sur un connecteur PS/2 de couleur verte. Certaines souris possèdent parfois une connectique USB. On distingue plusieurs grandes familles de souris : − Souris mécanique : La souris mécanique comporte une bille sur laquelle tournent deux rouleaux. Ces rouleaux comportent chacun un disque qui tourne entre une photodiode et une diode électroluminescente (LED c’est-à- dire composant électronique autorisant le passage d’un courant électrique dans un seul sens) laissant passer la lumière par séquence. Lorsque la lumière passe, la photodiode renvoie un bit (1), lorsqu'elle rencontre un obstacle, la photodiode renvoie un bit nul (0). A l'aide de ces informations, l'ordinateur peut connaître la position du curseur, voire sa vitesse. − Souris optique : La souris optique possède un fonctionnement basé sur l'analyse de la surface sur laquelle elle se déplace. Ainsi une souris optique est constituée d'une LED, d'un système d´acquisition d´images (IAS) et d'un processeur de signaux numériques (DSP). La LED est chargée d'éclairer la surface afin de permettre au système IAS d'acquérir l'image de la surface. Le DSP détermine le mouvement horizontal et vertical. Les souris optiques fonctionnent sur toutes surfaces non parfaitement lisses ou bien possédantes des dégradés de couleur. Les avantages principaux de ce type de dispositif de pointage par rapport aux souris mécaniques sont notamment une précision accrue ainsi qu'un palissement moindre. − Souris sans fil : Les souris sans fil (en anglais « cordless mouse ») sont de plus en plus populaires car elles peuvent être utilisées sans être physiquement reliées à l'ordinateur, ce qui procure une sensation de liberté. Au niveau de cette famille de souris, nous retrouvons aussi les souris infrarouges : ces souris sont utilisées en vis-à-vis avec un récepteur infrarouge connecté à l'ordinateur.

N.B. : Sur les ordinateurs portables, nous retrouvons d’autres types de souris qui répondent au double impératif de faible encombrement et d’ergonomie : le trackball est en quelque sorte une souris inversée (l’utilisateur fait tourner une petite bille enchâssée dans le socle de l’appareil, en avant du clavier) et le « touchpad » est une sorte de palette graphique fonctionnant avec des capteurs de pression qui détectent la position du doigt de l’utilisateur sur un petit rectangle de plastique. Actuellement, il est possible de retrouver sur le marché des souris, celles qui disposent de quatre boutons, pouvant faciliter la navigation aisée sur le réseau Internet. 3. Scanner (numériseur) Le nom « scanner » vient du verbe anglais « to scan » qui signifie balayer dans le sens de « balayer du regard ». Il s’agit d’un périphérique permettant de numériser des documents à partir d'un format « papier » et de générer des documents au format « électronique ou numérique » qu'il est possible d'enregistrer dans la mémoire de l'ordinateur. Le scanner est caractérisé par sa qualité de numérisation (résolution). On a plusieurs types d’appareils :  Les numériseurs médicaux permettant de prendre une image à l’aide des rayons X à l’intérieur du corps humain.  Les numériseurs qui permettent de numériser les documents.  Les systèmes de lecture de code-barres des caisses des magasins.  Les numériseurs de reconnaissance de billets de banque. 4.

Unité centrale L’unité de traitement est composée essentiellement par un boîtier dans lequel se trouvent logés, sur une carte mère, plusieurs composants informatiques. Les composants matériels de l'ordinateur sont architecturés autour d'une carte principale comportant quelques circuits intégrés et beaucoup de composants électroniques tels que condensateurs, résistances, etc. Tous ces composants sont soudés sur la carte et sont reliés par les connexions du circuit imprimé par un grand nombre de connecteurs : cette carte est appelée « carte-mère ». La carte-mère est logée dans un boitier, comportant des emplacements pour les périphériques de stockage sur la face avant, ainsi que des boutons permettant de contrôler la mise sous tension de l'ordinateur et un certain nombre de voyants permettant de vérifier l'état de marche de l'appareil et l'activité des disques durs. Sur la face arrière, le boîtier présente des ouvertures en vis-à-vis des cartes d'extension et des interfaces d'entrée-sortie connectées sur la carte-mère. Enfin, le boîtier héberge un bloc d'alimentation électrique, chargé de fournir un courant électrique stable et continu à l'ensemble des éléments constitutifs de l'ordinateur. L'alimentation sert donc à convertir le courant alternatif du réseau électrique (110 ou 220 Volts) en une tension continue de 5 Volts pour les composants de l'ordinateur et de 12 volts pour certains périphériques internes (disques, lecteurs de CD-ROM, ...). La puissance du bloc d'alimentation est généralement comprise entre 200 et 450 Watts. 1. La carte mère Prof. Dr. YENDE RAPHAEL Grevisse, PhD. Cours d’Informatique Générale / UNIBAS"}

Bref tous les éléments externes que l’on utilise couramment. C’est un élément essentiel au fonctionnement de l’ordinateur, dont voici sa description : 2. Microprocesseur Le centre nerveux de la machine est le microprocesseur. Il s’agit d’un composant électronique très sophistiqué et très miniaturisé. Le cœur d'un processeur est l'Unité Arithmétique et Logique (UAL) qui permet d'effectuer des opérations arithmétiques, logiques, ou d'opérations sur la mémoire (par exemple la lecture du contenu de la mémoire). L’avantage du microprocesseur sur l'être humain est sa vitesse de calcul. Actuellement, les microprocesseurs sont souvent capables d'exécuter plus de 3 milliards d'opérations par seconde. Les microprocesseurs (et donc les ordinateurs) sont incapables d'effectuer le moindre travail si on ne leur fournit pas des listes d'instructions précises dans le seul langage qu'ils comprennent : le langage machine. De telles listes d'instructions sont appelées des programmes d'ordinateur. Le processeur dispose de deux types de mémoires :  La mémoire cache, qui est une sorte de réservoir de mémoire intermédiaire entre le processeur et la mémoire centrale. La caractéristique fonctionnelle de la mémoire cache est de servir à stocker des instructions et des données provenant de la mémoire centrale et qui ont déjà été utilisées les plus récemment par le processeur central.  Les registres : il s’agit d’une sorte de tiroirs, un circuit qui permet la mémorisation de n bits en même temps.

Entre deux tops d'horloge le processeur effectue une action. Une instruction nécessite une ou plusieurs actions du processeur. Ainsi plus l'horloge a une fréquence élevée, plus le processeur effectue d'instructions par seconde (l'unité retenue pour caractériser le nombre d'instructions traitées par unité de temps est généralement le MIPS, Millions d'instruction par seconde). Par exemple un ordinateur ayant une fréquence de 100 Mhz effectue 100.000.000 d'instructions par seconde ;  Une unité de gestion des bus qui gère les flux d'informations entrant et sortant ;  Une unité d'instruction qui lit les données arrivant, les décode puis les envoie à l'unité d'exécution ;  Une unité d'exécution qui accomplit les tâches que lui a donné l'unité d'instruction. 3. les mémoires A. Disque dur Le disque dur est un support magnétique de stockage d’informations contenu dans l’unité centrale offrant des vastes espaces de stockage. Inventé dans les années 1950 par IBM, sa capacité augmente très rapidement tandis que son encombrement se réduit. En fait, Un disque dur est constitué non pas d'un seul disque, mais de plusieurs disques rigides (en anglais hard disk signifie disque dur) en métal, en verre ou en céramique, empilés à une très faible distance les uns des autres et appelés plateaux.

La lecture et l'écriture se fait grâce à des têtes de lecture situées de part et d'autre de chacun des plateaux. Ces têtes sont des électro-aimants qui se baissent et se soulèvent pour pouvoir lire l'information ou l'écrire. Les têtes ne sont qu'à quelques microns de la surface, séparées par une couche d'air provoquée par la rotation des disques qui crée un vent d'environ 250km/h ! De plus ces têtes sont mobiles latéralement afin de pouvoir balayer l'ensemble de la surface du disque. Un disque dur est au minimum composé de pistes numérotées et de secteurs numérotés, les données sont stockées dans les secteurs. Dans une pile de disques, on ajoute la notion de cylindre qui repère toutes les pistes portant le même numéro sur chaque face de chacun des disques de la pile. B. La Mémoire vive (RAM) La mémoire vive, généralement appelée RAM (Random Access Memory, qui signifie mémoire à accès aléatoire) ou encore mémoire volatile, est la mémoire principale du système, c'est-à-dire qu'il s'agit d'un espace permettant de stocker de manière temporaire des données lors de l'exécution d'un programme. Il s’agit d’une mémoire dans laquelle il est possible de lire et d’écrire. En effet, le stockage de données dans la mémoire vive est temporaire, contrairement au stockage de données sur une mémoire de masse telle que le disque dur, car elle permet uniquement de stocker des données tant qu'elle est alimentée électriquement. Ainsi, à chaque fois que l'ordinateur est éteint, toutes les données présentes en mémoire sont irrémédiablement effacées. C. Mémoire morte (ROM) La mémoire morte, appelée ROM pour Read Only Memory (signifie mémoire en lecture seule) est un type de mémoire permettant de conserver les informations qui y sont contenues même lorsque la mémoire n'est plus alimentée électriquement.

A la base ce type de mémoire ne peut être accédée qu'en lecture. Toutefois il est désormais possible d'enregistrer des informations dans certaines mémoires de type ROM. Ce type de mémoire permet notamment de conserver les données nécessaires au démarrage basique de l'ordinateur. En effet, ces informations ne peuvent être stockées sur le disque dur étant donné que les paramètres du disque (essentiels à son initialisation) font partie de ces données vitales à l'amorçage. II.6.1.3. Les unités de sortie Il existe plusieurs unités de sortie dont le principal est l’écran. 1. Ecran On appelle écran (ou moniteur), le périphérique d’affichage de l’ordinateur. Les moniteurs sont la plupart du temps des tubes cathodiques (notés CRT, soit cathode ray tube ou en français tube à rayonnement cathodique), c'est à dire un tube en verre sous vide dans lequel un canon à électrons émet un flux d'électrons dirigés par un champ électrique vers un écran couvert de petits éléments phosphorescents. L'écran est recouvert d'une fine couche d'éléments phosphorescents, appelés luminophores, émettant de la lumière par excitation lorsque les électrons viennent les heurter, ce qui constitue un point lumineux appelé pixel. Un moniteur noir et blanc permet d'afficher des dégradés de couleur (niveaux de gris) en variant l'intensité du rayon. Pour les moniteurs couleurs, trois faisceaux d'électrons (donc trois cathodes) viennent chacun heurter un point d'une couleur spécifique : un rouge, un vert et un bleu (RGB : Red, Green, Blue ) ou en français RVB Rouge, vert, bleu.

La technologie LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) est basée sur un écran composé de deux plaques transparentes entre lesquelles est coincée une fine couche de liquide contenant des molécules (cristaux) qui ont la propriété de s'orienter lorsqu'elles sont soumises à du courant électrique. L'avantage majeur de ce type d'écran est son encombrement réduit, d'où son utilisation sur les ordinateurs portables. Les moniteurs sont souvent caractérisés par les données suivantes :  La définition : c'est le nombre de points (pixel) que l'écran peut afficher, ce nombre de points est généralement compris entre 640x480 (640 points en longueur, 480 points en largeur) et 1600x1200, mais des résolutions supérieures sont techniquement possibles ;  La taille : Elle se calcule en mesurant la diagonale de l'écran et est exprimée en pouces, c'est-à-dire 2.54 cm. Il faut veiller à ne pas confondre la définition de l'écran et sa taille. En effet un écran d'une taille donnée peut afficher différentes définitions, cependant de façon générale les écrans de grande taille possèdent une meilleure définition ;  Le pas de masque (en anglais dot pitch) : C'est la distance qui sépare deux photophores ; plus celle-ci est petite plus l'image est précise. Ainsi un pas de masque inférieur ou égal à 0,25 mm procurera un bon confort d'utilisation, tandis que les écrans possédant des pas de masque supérieurs ou égaux à 0,28 mm seront à proscrire ;  La résolution : Elle détermine le nombre de pixels par unité de surface, pixels par pouce linéaire (en anglais DPI : Dots Per Inch, traduisez points par pouce). Une résolution de 300 dpi signifie 300 colonnes et 300 rangées de pixels sur un pouce carré ce qui donnerait donc 90000 pixels sur un pouce carré ;  La fréquence de balayage verticale (refresh rate en anglais) : Elle représente le nombre d'images qui sont affichées par seconde, on l'appelle aussi"}

Imprimante L'imprimante permet de faire une sortie imprimée (sur papier ou sur tout autre support) des données de l'ordinateur. Il en existe plusieurs types dont les plus courants sont :  L’imprimante matricielle : Elle permet d'imprimer des documents grâce à un va-et-vient de la tête sur le papier. La tête est constituée de petites aiguilles, poussées par des électro-aimants, qui viennent taper contre un ruban de carbone situé entre la tête et le papier. Ce ruban de carbone défile pour qu'il y ait continuellement de l'encre dessus. A chaque fin de ligne un rouleau fait tourner la feuille. Les imprimantes matricielles les plus récentes sont équipées de têtes d'impression comportant 24 aiguilles, ce qui leur permet d'imprimer avec une résolution de 216 points par pouce.  L’imprimante à jet d’encre : La technologie du jet d'encre a été inventée par Canon, elle repose sur le principe simple mais efficace qu'un fluide chauffé produit des bulles. Le chercheur qui a découvert ce principe avait mis accidentellement en contact une seringue remplie d'encre et un fer à souder, cela créa une bulle dans la seringue qui fit jaillir de l'encre de la seringue. Chaque buse produit une bulle minuscule qui fait éjecter une gouttelette extrêmement fine. Le vide engendré par la baisse de pression aspire une nouvelle goutte ...  L’imprimante LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulation of Emission Radiation) : L'imprimante laser reproduit à l'aide de points l'image que lui envoie le PC par le port LPT (line printing) ou USB. Grâce au laser, les points sont plus petits et la définition est meilleure. Ainsi, l'imprimante Laser n'ayant pas de tête mécanique est beaucoup plus rapide et moins bruyante.

En effet une imprimante ne peut pas imprimer « à froid », il lui est nécessaire d'atteindre une certaine température pour fonctionner de manière optimale.  La mémoire embarquée : il s'agit de la quantité de mémoire permettant à l'imprimante de stocker les travaux d'impression. Plus la quantité de mémoire n’est élevée, plus la file d'attente des travaux peuvent être importante.  Les cartouches : les cartouches sont rarement standards et dépendent fortement de la marque et du modèle d'imprimante. Ainsi, certains constructeurs privilégient des cartouches multicolores, tandis que d'autres proposent des cartouches d'encre séparées. Les cartouches d'encre séparées sont globalement plus économiques car il n'est pas rare qu'une couleur soit plus utilisée que les autres. NB : Il existe des périphériques d’entrée/sortie qui servent à stocker les données et les programmes. Il s’agit entre autre : clef USB, CD, DVD, disque dur ou disquette, etc. 3. Notion sur le bus On appelle « bus », en informatique, un ensemble de liaisons physiques (câbles, pistes de circuits imprimés, ...) pouvant être exploitées en commun par plusieurs éléments matériels afin de communiquer. Un bus est caractérisé par le volume d'informations transmises simultanément (exprimé en bits), correspondant au nombre de lignes sur lesquelles les données sont envoyées de manière simultanée. Une nappe de 32 fils permet ainsi de transmettre 32 bits en parallèle. On parle ainsi de « largeur de bus » pour désigner le nombre de bits qu'il peut transmettre simultanément.

On distingue généralement sur un ordinateur deux types de bus : le bus système et les bus d’extension permettant de connecter des cartes d'extensions. − Le bus système permet au processeur de communiquer avec la mémoire centrale du système (mémoire vive ou RAM). Le bus interne est lui-même subdivisé en deux bus :  Le bus d'adresses (ou bus mémoire) transporte les adresses mémoire auxquelles le processeur souhaite accéder pour lire ou écrire une donnée.  Le bus de données véhicule les informations en provenance ou à destination du processeur. − Le bus d'extension (parfois appelé bus d'entrée/sortie) permet aux divers composants de la carte mère (USB, série, parallèle, disques durs, lecteurs et graveurs de CD-ROM, etc.) de communiquer entre eux mais il permet surtout l'ajout de nouveaux périphériques grâce aux connecteurs d'extension (appelés slots) connectés sur le bus d'entrées-sorties. On parle généralement de bridge (en français pont) pour désigner un élément d'interconnexion entre deux bus. 4. Notions de ports d’entrée-sortie Les ports sont des prises que l’on trouve à l’arrière de l’ordinateur et qui permettent de brancher divers matériels. Les ports d'entrée-sortie sont des éléments matériels de l'ordinateur, permettant au système de communiquer avec des éléments extérieurs, c'est-à-dire d'échanger des données, d'où l'appellation d'interface d'entrée-sortie (notée parfois interface d'E/S). a. Les ports « série » Les ports série représentent les premières interfaces ayant permis aux ordinateurs d'échanger des informations avec le \"monde extérieur\". Le terme série désigne un envoi de données via un fil unique : les bits sont envoyés les uns à la suite des autres. A l'origine les ports série permettaient uniquement d'envoyer des données, mais pas d'en recevoir, c'est pourquoi des ports bidirectionnels ont été mis au point (ceux qui équipent les ordinateurs actuels le sont) ; les ports séries bidirectionnels ont donc besoin de deux fils pour effectuer la communication.

Les connecteurs séries possèdent généralement 9 broches (connecteur DB9) : b. Les ports parallèles La transmission de données en parallèle consiste à envoyer des données simultanément sur plusieurs canaux (fils). Les ports parallèles présents sur les ordinateurs personnels permettent d'envoyer simultanément 8 bits (un octet) par l'intermédiaire de 8 fils. Les premiers ports parallèles bidirectionnels permettaient d'atteindre des débits (volume d’informations qu’il est possible de traiter) de l'ordre de 2.4Mb/s. Toutefois des ports parallèles améliorés ont été mis au point afin d'obtenir des débits plus élevés. Les ports parallèles sont, comme les ports série, intégrés à la carte mère. Les connecteurs DB25 permettent de connecter un élément extérieur (une imprimante par exemple). c. Les ports USB Les ports USB (Universal Serial Bus, ports séries universels) sont basés sur une architecture de type série. Il s'agit toutefois d'une interface entrée-sortie beaucoup plus rapide que les ports série standards. L’architecture USB a pour caractéristique de fournir l’alimentation électrique aux périphériques qu’elle relie. Elle utilise pour cela un câble composé de quatre fils (la masse GND, l’alimentation VBUS et deux fils de données appelés D- et D+). Ainsi, il est possible de brancher les périphériques sans éteindre l’ordinateur (branchement à chaud). Lors de la connexion du périphérique à l’hôte, ce dernier détecte l’ajout du nouvel élément grâce au changement de la tension entre les fils D+ et D-. A ce moment, l’ordinateur envoie un signal d’initialisation au périphérique, puis lui fournit du courant grâce aux fils GND et VBUS. Le périphérique est alors alimenté en courant électrique et récupère temporairement l’adresse par défaut (l’adresse 0). L’étape suivante consiste à lui fournir son adresse définitive (c’est la procédure d’énumération). Pour cela, l’ordinateur interroge les périphériques déjà branchés pour connaître la leur et en attribue une au nouveau, qui en retour s’identifie.

C’est ainsi, Lorsque nous voulons interpréter quelles informations transitent dans un réseau, et quand elles circulent, il convient de les représenter de manière facilement compréhensible, Alors présumons qu’un ordinateur A doive envoyer l’image représentée dans la figure ci-dessous vers un autre ordinateur B, après avoir convenu de la taille de cette image et de l’ordre d’envoi des éléments la constituant. La description se fera, par exemple, carré par carré, ligne par ligne, en commençant en haut à gauche, pour finir en bas à droite. Il est en effet impossible d’envoyer l’image telle quelle sans la coder. La séquence de couleurs à envoyer est donc (en notant blanc B et noir A) : AAAAA ABBBA ABABA ABBBA AAAAA Représentation à transmettre3 Une manière de coder la couleur de chaque carré consiste à associer une valeur à chaque couleur possible, par exemple 1 à B (le pixel sur l’écran est allumé) et 0 à A (le pixel est éteint).

Représentation des données Par définition, « une donnée » est une représentation d'une information sous une forme conventionnelle destinée à faciliter son traitement.

L’utilisation de la base 2 garantit de pouvoir représenter un état stable d’un système physique, par exemple : circuit électrique ouvert/fermé, ou carte perforée avec un trou/sans trou . . .

Les systèmes de numération Un système de numération est un système de représentation des nombres utilisant un certain nombre des symboles. Autrement dit, c’est un ensemble de conventions et des méthodes permettant de nommer, d’écrire les nombres et d’effectuer les calculer. La base de numération indique le nombre de différents symboles utilisés par ce système. Un système de numération est caractérisé par : − La base indiquant le nombre de symboles utilisés dans le système ; − Les symboles appelés chiffres ; − Les normes de formation d‘une unité et du nombre immédiatement supérieur au chiffre le plus élevé de la base : chaque des chiffres du système représente un coefficient multiplicateur d‘une puissance de la base selon la position du chiffre dans un nombre, la première puissance à droite étant égale à 0 et allant progressant vers la gauche. La position d‘un chiffre à l‘intérieur d‘un nombre défini son rang. Il existe plusieurs systèmes de numération en informatique, mais dans le cadre de ce cours, nous ne parlerons que de 4 systèmes de numération :  Le système décimal ;  Le système octal ;  Le système binaire ;  Le système hexadécimal.

Le système décimal Le système décimal est celui dans lequel nous avons le plus l'habitude d'écrire où chaque chiffre peut avoir 10 valeurs différentes tels : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, de ce fait, le système décimal a pour base 10. Tout nombre écrit dans le système décimal vérifie la relation suivante : 745 = 7 × 100 + 4 × 10 + 5 × 1 745 = 7 × 10 × 10 + 4 × 10 + 5 × 1 745 = 7 × 102 + 4 × 101 + 5 × 100 Chaque chiffre du nombre est à multiplier par une puissance de 10 : c'est ce que l'on nomme le poids du chiffre. L'exposant de cette puissance est nul pour le chiffre situé le plus à droite et s'accroît d'une unité pour chaque passage à un chiffre vers la gauche. 12 435 = 1 × 104 + 2 × 103 + 4 × 102 + 3 × 101 + 5 × 100. Cette façon d'écrire les nombres est appelée système de numération de position.

Pour la partie entière, divisez PE et chacun des quotients successifs par 2 jusqu’à obtenir un quotient nul c’est-à-dire égal à 0. La suite des restes dans l’ordre inverse de leur obtention. Pour la partie fractionnaire, multipliez PF et les parties fractionnaires des produits successifs par 2 jusqu’à obtenir soit une partie fractionnaire nulle, soit une répétition de cette partie. NB : la conversion d’un nombre binaire en son équivalent décimal passe par la multiplication de chaque élément du nombre binaire par le chiffre 2 élevé à une puissance ne croissant par pas de 1 compté à partir de 0 en partant de la droite, puis on effectue la somme des résultats obtenus.

Toutefois le problème est qu'un nombre mathématique peut être infini (aussi grand que l'on veut), mais la représentation d'un nombre dans un ordinateur doit être fait sur un nombre de bits prédéfini. Il s'agit donc de prédéfinir un nombre de bits et la manière de les utiliser pour que ceux-ci servent le plus efficacement possible à représenter l'entité. Ainsi il serait idiot de coder un caractère sur 16 bits (65536 possibilités) alors qu'on en utilise généralement moins de 256 ... actuellement, il existe : III.4.1. Le code DCB (Décimal codé binaire). Dans ce système, les nombres seront représentés dans la logique décimale, toute fois chaque chiffre sera converti séparément en binaire en gardant son rang dans le nombre donné. Le besoin d‘harmoniser le nombre de caractères pour représenter chaque chiffre s‘est vite manifesté. Pour cela il a fallu convertir tous les chiffres du système décimal et constater le nombre maximum des positions requisses pour représenter chaque chiffre du système décimal en binaire. Cela étant, le code DCB va convertir les chiffres décimaux en binaire de 4 positions. … Bref, c’est un code qui date des années 50, de longueur 4, et ne possédant pas de minuscules. III.4.2.

NOTIONS SUR LES SYSTEMES D’EXPLOITATION IV.1. Définition et contexte d’étude En informatique, un système d'exploitation (souvent appelé « OS » de l'anglais Operating System) est un ensemble de programmes qui dirige l'utilisation des ressources d'un ordinateur par des logiciels applicatifs. Le rôle principal d’un système d’exploitation est d’assurer la liaison entre les ressources, l’utilisateur et les applications en créant une machine virtuelle et son interface. Il reçoit des demandes d'utilisation des ressources de l’ordinateur ressources de stockage des mémoires (par exemple des accès à la mémoire vive, aux disques durs), ressources de calcul du processeur central, ressources de communication vers des périphériques (pour parfois demander des ressources de calcul au GPU par exemple ou tout autre carte d’extension) ou via le réseau de la part des logiciels applicatifs. Le système d'exploitation gère les demandes ainsi que les ressources nécessaires évitant les interférences entre les logiciels. Le système d'exploitation est le logiciel système :  Il est le système principal car il permet à l'ordinateur et aux programmes de fonctionner par lui ;  Il est le système qui se lance en second après le firmware (programme d’amorcage ou bootloader) exécuté lors de la mise en marche de l'ordinateur. Le système d’exploitation offre une suite de services généraux facilitant la création de logiciels applicatifs et sert d'intermédiaire entre ces logiciels et le matériel informatique. Un système d'exploitation apporte commodité, efficacité et capacité d'évolution, permettant d'introduire de nouvelles fonctions et du nouveau matériel sans remettre en cause les logiciels. Il existe sur le marché des dizaines de systèmes d'exploitation différents, très souvent livrés avec l'appareil informatique. C'est le cas de Windows, MacOs, Irix, Symbian OS, Unix, GNU/Linux (pour lequel il existe de nombreuses distributions) ou Android. Les fonctionnalités offertes diffèrent d'un système à l'autre et sont typiquement en rapport avec l'exécution des programmes, l'utilisation de la mémoire centrale ou des périphériques, la manipulation des systèmes de fichiers, la communication, ou la détection et la gestion d'erreurs.

Typologie des systèmes d’exploitation] 51 IV.2. Objectifs des systèmes d’exploitation Tous les systèmes d’exploitation sont créés pour uniquement deux objectifs : − Transformer le matériel informatique (ordinateur) en une machine utilisable : cela veut dire que chaque système d’exploitation est fourni avec des outils adaptés aux, besoins de l’utilisateur indépendamment des caractéristiques physiques de son ordinateur. − Optimisez l’utilisation des ressources (matériels et logiciels) : cela veut dire que le système d’exploitation est dans l’obligation de rendre favorable (facile à utiliser) l’exploitation de l’ordinateur. Ces deux objectifs poursuivent les résultats ci-après :  Sécurité des données traitées : ce qui renvoies à l’intégrité, contrôle des accès, à la confidentialité. Bref, l’absence totale du danger lors de l’exploitation de l’ordinateur.  Fiabilité : satisfaction des utilisateurs, même dans les conditions hostiles et imprévues.  Performance du système informatique : c’est le degré de satisfaction des utilisateurs en termes chiffrés et des résultats obtenus. IV.3 Fonctions d’un système d’exploitation Le système d'exploitation offre une suite de services généraux facilitant la création et l'utilisation de logiciels applicatifs. Les services offerts sont en rapport avec l'utilisation des ressources de l'ordinateur par les programmes. Ils permettent en particulier d'exécuter des programmes, de lire et écrire des informations, de manipuler les fichiers , de communiquer et de déceler des erreurs. Ces services permettent à plusieurs usagers et plusieurs programmes de se partager les ressources de l'ordinateur. La principale fonction du système d'exploitation est de joindre les différences entre les différentes architectures informatiques, et d'organiser l'utilisation des ressources de manière rationnelle. Ainsi, il regroupe alors ses fonctions en 5 classes : 1. La gestion du processus Cette fonction est aussi appelée « gestion des applications » ou « gestion de l’exécution », c’est lorsque le système d’exploitation permet de gérer l’allocation des taches d’un processeur au moyen d’un séquenceur qui ordonnance les processus les uns après les autres. La gestion du processus consiste également à s’assurer qu’il y a une bonne exécution des applications, leur affectation des ressources nécessaires à leur fonctionnement en détectant et en corrigeant les erreurs échéantes.

Typologie des systèmes d’exploitation] 52 2. La gestion de la mémoire C’est lorsque le système d’exploitation permet de gérer l’espace- mémoire alloué a chaque application utilisée par l’utilisateur (en créant des mémoires virtuelles). Le système d'exploitation dirige l'utilisation de la mémoire. Il réserve un emplacement de mémoire lorsqu'un processus le demande, et le libère lorsqu'il n'est plus utilisé, par exemple lorsque le processus s'est arrêté. La quantité de mémoire utilisée par l'ensemble du système informatique dépend essentiellement de la manière dont le système d'exploitation effectue les réservations. Le mécanisme dit « mémoire virtuelle » est destiné à simuler la présence ou l'absence de mémoire centrale par manipulation de l'unité de gestion mémoire. C'est un mécanisme courant dans les systèmes d'exploitation contemporains. La mémoire virtuelle permet d'exécuter simultanément plus de programmes que ce que la mémoire centrale peut contenir. Chaque programme n'ayant pas besoin que la totalité des informations qu'il manipule soit présente dans la mémoire centrale, une partie des informations est stockée dans la mémoire de masse (en général dans un fichier ou une partition de disque dur) habituellement plus importante mais plus lente et sont transférées en mémoire centrale lorsque le programme en a besoin. Ainsi donc, Les programmes disposent d'un ou plusieurs espaces virtuels de mémoire continus pour travailler. 3. La gestion des fichiers Un fichier est une collection d'informations portant un nom, enregistrée sur un média tel qu'un disque dur, une bande magnétique ou un disque optique. Chaque médium a ses propres caractéristiques et sa propre organisation. Le système d'exploitation s'occupe de créer et de détruire des fichiers et des répertoires, de réserver de l'espace sur les médias ainsi que copier le contenu des fichiers de et vers la mémoire centrale. Il aide également les logiciels applicatifs à retrouver les fichiers, partager les fichiers entre plusieurs utilisateurs, modifier le contenu des fichiers et créer des répertoires (permettant de classer et d'organiser les fichiers). La vitesse du système informatique dépendra de la vitesse de manipulation des fichiers.

Dans un système d'exploitation multi-utilisateurs, les programmes manipulant le système de fichiers effectuent des contrôles pour vérifier qu'aucun fichier n'est manipulé par une personne non autorisée. Ce type de système d'exploitation refusera toute manipulation non autorisée. 4. La gestion de communication Cette fonction est aussi appelée « gestion de l’interface », c’est lorsque le système d’exploitation permet l’interaction entre l’utilisateur la machine au moyen d’un langage informatique ou d’une interface qui peut être soit graphique, en mode commande ligne ou tactile aussi appelée « spatiale ». 5. La gestion des périphériques Cette fonction aussi appelée « gestion des entrées/sorties ». C’est lorsque le système d’exploitation permet de gérer les accès aux ressources matérielles de l’ordinateur par l’intermédiaires des pilotes. IV.4. Typologie des systèmes d’exploitation Il existe cinq typologies (générations) de systèmes d'exploitation : par lots (batch), multi programmés, en temps partagé, temps réel, et distribués. Chacun des principes mis en œuvre dans une typologie se retrouve dans les générations suivantes : 1. Les systèmes d’exploitation de traitement par lots (batch) Ce sont des systèmes prévus pour l'exécution de grands calculs les uns après les autres, avec peu d'intervention utilisateur. À partir de la génération des systèmes d'exploitation multiprogrammés, plusieurs programmes sont exécutés simultanément par planification (scheduling). Dans ces systèmes d'exploitation multitâches, plusieurs programmes résident dans la mémoire centrale et le système d'exploitation suspend régulièrement l'exécution d'un programme pour continuer l'exécution d'un autre. Les systèmes d'exploitation basés sur le traitement par « lots » (suites d'instructions et de données dans un ensemble de cartes perforées) sont apparus dans les années 1950. Un programme (avec ses données) n'est rien d'autre qu'une pile de cartes avec des indicateurs de début et de fin de lot. L'exécution d'un programme consiste à demander à un opérateur de placer la pile de cartes dans le lecteur, puis l'opérateur lance la lecture séquentielle des cartes. Le processeur central est au repos, durant les manipulations de l'opérateur. Un batch est un lot de travaux à"}

Typologie des systèmes d’exploitation] 54 grande pile de cartes séparées par des marque-pages, en général une carte de couleur particulière, qu'il place ensuite dans le lecteur. Le regroupement de plusieurs programmes en un batch diminue les interventions de l'opérateur. Dans un système basé sur les batchs, le cœur du système d'exploitation est un programme moniteur qui réside continuellement en mémoire centrale et permet à l'opérateur de demander le début ou l'arrêt de l'exécution du lot. À la fin de l'exécution de chaque tâche du lot, le moniteur effectue des travaux de nettoyage, puis lance l'exécution de la tâche suivante. Ainsi, l'opérateur intervient uniquement au début et à la fin du lot. En raison de la grande différence de vitesse entre le processeur et les périphériques, dans un système d'exploitation batch, le processeur est inutilisé 90 % du temps car les programmes attendent qu'un périphérique ou un autre termine les opérations. Avec ces systèmes d'exploitation il n'y a pas de concurrence entre les différentes tâches, la mise en œuvre de l'utilisation du processeur, de la mémoire et des périphériques est triviale mais loin d’être optimale. … Les systèmes d'exploitation batch sont adaptés à des applications nécessitant de très gros calculs mais peu d'implication de l'utilisateur : météo, statistiques, impôts... Les utilisateurs n'attendent pas immédiatement de résultats. Ils soumettent les demandes, puis reviennent ultérieurement collecter les résultats. 2. Les systèmes d’exploitation multiprogrammées Les systèmes d'exploitation multi-programmés sont apparus dans les années 1960. Le but recherché par de tels systèmes est d'augmenter l'efficacité de l'utilisation du processeur et des périphériques en utilisant la possibilité de les faire fonctionner en parallèle. Plusieurs programmes sont placés en mémoire centrale, et lorsque le programme en cours d'exécution attend un résultat de la part d'un périphérique, le système d'exploitation ordonne au processeur d'exécuter un autre programme. Dans les systèmes d'exploitation multi-programmés, l'utilisation du processeur est partagée par planification (scheduling) : à chaque utilisation d'un périphérique, le système d'exploitation choisit quel programme va être exécuté.

Les systèmes multi-programmés nécessitent un ordinateur et des périphériques mettant en œuvre la technique du DMA (direct memory access). Selon celle-ci, le processeur ordonne à un périphérique d'effectuer une opération, le résultat de l'opération est ensuite placé en mémoire centrale par le périphérique tandis que le processeur exécute d'autres instructions.

Les systèmes d’exploitation en temps partagé Les systèmes d'exploitation en temps partagé sont apparus dans les années 1970. Ils sont utilisés dans des dispositifs interactifs où plusieurs utilisateurs sont simultanément en dialogue avec l'ordinateur. Un système d'exploitation en temps partagé est destiné à répondre rapidement aux demandes de l'utilisateur, et donner à chaque utilisateur l'impression qu'il est le seul à utiliser l'ordinateur. Un système en temps partagé met en œuvre des techniques sophistiquées de multiprogrammation en vue de permettre l'utilisation interactive de l'ordinateur par plusieurs utilisateurs et plusieurs programmes simultanément. L'arrivée, en 1970, de cette nouvelle génération de systèmes d'exploitation résulte d'une forte demande des consommateurs, et de la baisse du prix du matériel informatique ayant rendu possible sa réalisation. Dans les systèmes d'exploitation en temps partagé la notion de batch n'a que peu d'importance. Ces systèmes mettent en œuvre de nouveaux mécanismes d'utilisation du processeur et de la mémoire, qui leur permet de répondre rapidement à des demandes provenant simultanément d'un grand nombre d'utilisateurs. Dans ces systèmes, tout comme dans la génération précédente, l'utilisation du processeur est planifiée. Cependant, contrairement aux systèmes de la génération précédente, dans les systèmes en temps partagé chaque programme est exécuté durant une tranche de temps déterminé, puis le système d'exploitation bascule sur l'exécution d'un autre programme, ce qui évite qu'un programme monopolise l'utilisation du processeur au service d'un utilisateur, entraînant des retards pour les autres utilisateurs. Les systèmes d'exploitation en temps partagé mettent en œuvre la technique du swap : lorsque le programme en cours d'exécution a besoin de plus de mémoire que celle disponible, un autre programme inactif est retiré pour gagner de la place, le programme inactif est alors enregistré temporairement sur le disque dur. L'enregistrement sur disque provoque cependant une perte de temps non négligeable. 4.

Certains services offerts par ces systèmes d'exploitation sont réalisés comme des logiciels applicatifs, et sont exécutés en concurrence avec ceux-ci. Un système d'exploitation temps réel autorise un contact direct entre les logiciels applicatifs et les périphériques. Dans certains systèmes temps réel les ressources sont réservées, évitant ainsi les ralentissements que provoqueraient les réservations à la volée, et garantissant que les ressources sont continuellement disponibles. Les systèmes d'exploitation temps-réel évitent d'utiliser la technique du swap en raison des risques de dépassement des délais. On peut citer les systèmes d’exploitation tels que : Symbian OS, PalmOS ? RTX, Windows, Embedded Linux, etc. 5. Les systèmes d’exploitation distribuées La baisse des prix du matériel informatique a permis, dans les années 1990, la création de systèmes informatiques composés de plusieurs ordinateurs, et donc plusieurs processeurs, plusieurs mémoires, et de nombreux périphériques. Un système distribué permet le partage des ressources entre les ordinateurs. Un utilisateur d'un ordinateur bon marché peut se servir de ressources coûteuses existant sur un autre ordinateur. Un système distribué dirige l'utilisation des ressources de plusieurs ordinateurs à la fois. Il utilise les capacités d'un réseau informatique, contrôle un groupe de machines, et les fait apparaître comme une machine unique, virtuelle, de très grande capacité.

CLASSIFICATION DE LOGICIELS] 57 CHAPITRE V. NOTIONS SUR LES LOGICIELS INFORMATIQUES V.1. Définition et contexte d’étude Le terme anglais « software » a été utilisé dès 1953 pour distinguer la partie modifiable de l'ordinateur, par opposition au « hardware » qui est la partie matérielle permanente. Il est apparu dans la littérature pendant les années 1960. En français, le mot « logiciel » est formé en 1960 en France à partir des mots « logique » et « matériel » comme traduction par la Délégation à l’informatique chargée du Plan Calcul. Ce terme a été adopté par l'Académie française en 1972. En informatique, un « logiciel » est un ensemble de séquences d’instructions interprétables par une machine nécessaire à ces opérations. Le logiciel détermine donc les tâches qui peuvent être effectuées par la machine, ordonne son fonctionnement et lui procure ainsi son utilité fonctionnelle. Les séquences d’instructions appelées « programmes » ainsi que les données du logiciel sont ordinairement structurées en « fichiers ». La mise en œuvre des instructions du logiciel est appelée « exécutable ou exécution » et la machine chargée de cette mise en œuvre est appelée ordinateur ou calculateur. Les logiciels sont créés et livrés à la demande d'un client ou sur l'initiative du producteur, et mis sur le marché, parfois gratuitement. En 1980, 60 % de la production et 52 % de la consommation mondiale de logiciels est aux Etats-Unis. Les logiciels sont aussi distribués illégalement et la valeur marchande des produits ainsi distribués est parfois supérieure au chiffre d'affaires des producteurs. Les logiciels libres sont créés et distribués comme des commodités produites par coopération entre les utilisateurs et les auteurs. Créer un logiciel est un travail intellectuel qui prend du temps. La création de logiciels est souvent le fait d'une équipe, qui suit une démarche logique et planifiée en vue d'obtenir un produit de bonne qualité dans les meilleurs délais. V.2.

Les solutions de middleware regroupent divers logiciels, notamment : Les API (Interface de Programmation d’application) ; Les serveurs d’applications ; Les logiciels d’intégration d’applications ; Les logiciels d’intégration des données ; Les logiciels de traitement transactionnel ; Les logiciels d’appel de procédure à distance (RPC – Remote Procedure Call) ; Les logiciels orientés message (MOM - Message Oriented Middleware) ; Les logiciels ORB (Object Request Broker). 4. Les logiciels génériques (particuliers ou standard) Ce sont des logiciels commercialisés comme les produits courants sur le marché informatique. Dans cette catégorie, on en distingue autant :  Logiciels amateurs : Il s’agit de logiciels développés par des « amateurs » (par exemple par des gens passionnés ou des étudiants qui apprennent à programmer). Bref, ce sont des logiciels sans impact économique significatif sur l’ensemble.  Logiciels « jetables » ou « consommables » : Il s’agit de logiciels comme par exemple les logiciels des traitements de texte ou les tableurs pour les entreprises. Ces logiciels ne coûtent pas très cher, et peuvent être remplacés facilement au sein d’une entreprise sans engendrer des risques majeurs. Ils sont souvent largement diffusés.  Les progiciels : (contraction du mot « produit » ou « professionnel » et « logiciel ») est un terme commercial qui désigne un logiciel professionnel standard et applicatif généralisé aux multiples fonctions, composé d'un ensemble de programmes paramétrables et destiné à être utilisé par une large clientèle. Les progiciels mis en œuvre dans les entreprises couvrent principalement les grands domaines suivants : les progiciels de gestion intégrée (ERP) ; les progiciels de gestion de la relation client (CRM) ; les progiciels de gestion de la chaine logistique (SCM) ; les progiciels de gestion des ressources humaines, etc. 5."}

Après cette période d'essai, l'utilisateur doit rétribuer l'auteur s'il veut continuer à utiliser le logiciel. Lorsque les fonctionnalités du shareware sont limitées, on parle aussi de logiciel de démonstration. Shareware est un mot valise anglais composé de to « share » (partager) et de « ware », troncation de « software ». Un shareware peut facilement être confondu avec un freeware, un logiciel abandonné (abandonware) ou un logiciel libre. Un shareware n'est pas forcément un logiciel libre, car il peut être livré sans son code source. De plus, lorsque celui-ci est fourni, le droit de le redistribuer n'est pas automatiquement accordé. Enfin, la distribution du logiciel lui-même n'est pas forcément libre. Un shareware peut être utilisé pendant une durée limitée ou un nombre d'utilisations qui sont indiquées par l'auteur. Cela permet de tester les fonctionnalités et voir si elles correspondent à ses besoins.

Definition et Context etude Le terme « Internet » est d'origine américaine et est dérivé du concept « Internetting » (« interconnecter des réseaux »), dont la première utilisation documentée remonte à octobre 1972 par Robert E. Kahn, dans le cadre de la première conférence sur la communication des ordinateurs ( ICCC : International Conference on Computer Communications) à Washington . Cependant les origines exactes du terme restent à déterminer. Toutefois, c'est le 1er janvier 1983 que le nom « Internet », déjà en usage pour désigner l'ensemble du réseau ARPANAET et de plusieurs réseaux informatiques, devient officiel. Ainsi, l’Internet est un réseau de communication international qui permet tant aux entreprises qu’aux particuliers de communiquer entre eux grâce à un ensemble de réseaux et d’ordinateurs. L’architecture du réseau est dite » Client- serveur » c’est-à-dire que les ordinateurs envoient leurs données (les serveurs) vers d’autres ordinateurs équipés de logiciel client ou navigateur (browser). VI.2. Historique de l’Internet Depuis des années 50, durant la guerre froide, le gouvernement américain se demandait comment protéger l’appareil de l’Etat contre une attaque nucléaire soviétique. C’est en 1964 qu’un chercheur proposa de créer un réseau de communication sans centre physique, le principe était de créer un ensemble de nœuds interconnectés. − En 1969, est créé le réseau Arpanet, ancêtre de l’Internet actuel, était un réseau financé par le département américain de la défense, et une de ses agences : « Advenced Reserch Projets Agency ». Il s’agit d’un réseau reliant les centres de recherche de l’armée et les universités américaines l’ARPA a développé le concept de l’Internet selon le principe précédent (nœuds interconnectés), puis adapta en 1972 le protocole nommé TCP/IP (Transport control protocol / Internet prptocol) : nouvelle technologie de commutation de données par paquets et nouveau protocole d’échange. Tel protocole est né en réponse au défi de trouver un langage commun à tous les réseaux existant à l’échelle mondiale, et qui fut l’objet de la conférence internationale qui eut lieu en 1972, à Washington. − En 1974, c’est la naissance de l’Internet dans sa"}

Pour les entreprises (à l’exception des constructeurs informatiques et de quelques points avancés, il a fallu attendre 1994 pour que les opérateurs privés proposent des services de connexion à l’Internet.

Effectivement, ses diverses applications offrent des opportunités qui étaient inimaginables auparavant. − En 1990, on voit l’apparition du premier navigateur web (browser), mêlant texte et image. Cette même année, la National Science Foundation (NSF) mandate une compagnie pour enregistrer « les noms de domaine ».

Les protocoles utilisés sur Internet Les protocoles logiciels utilisés sur internet sont les conventions ou langage de communication structurant les échanges d'informations nécessaires au transfert des contenus applicatifs pour l'usager final. Ils permettent notamment d'identifier les interfaces (donc les machines), de s'assurer de la réception des données envoyées, et de l'interopérabilité. Un protocole est un ensemble de règles qui définissent un langage afin de faire communiquer plusieurs ordinateurs . Ils sont définis par des normes ouvertes en informatique. Chaque protocole a des fonctions propres et, ensemble, ils fournissent un éventail de moyens permettant de répondre à la multiplicité et à la diversité des besoins sur internet. Les principaux sont les suivants, classés selon leur couche (IP, TCP et UDP) ; couches applicatives :  IP (Internet Protocol) aussi appelé IPv4 ou IPv6 : protocole réseau qui définit le mode d'échange élémentaire entre les ordinateurs participant au réseau en leur donnant une adresse unique sur celui-ci. Cependant, en raison de l'épuisement des adresses IPv4, une nouvelle norme voit le jour ; nommée IPv6, elle permet d'accueillir un plus grand nombre d'utilisateurs.  TCP (Transfer Control Protocol) : responsable de l'établissement de la connexion et du contrôle de la transmission. C'est un protocole de remise fiable. Il s'assure que le destinataire a bien reçu les données, au contraire d'UDP.  HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) : protocole mis en œuvre pour le chargement des pages web.  HTTPS : pendant du HTTP pour la navigation en mode sécurisé.  FTP (File Transfer Protocol) : protocole utilisé pour le transfert de fichiers sur Internet.  SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) : protocole bâtît sur SSH pour le transfert de fichiers sécurisé.  SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) : mode d'échange du courrier électronique en envoi.  POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) : mode d'échange du courrier électronique en réception.  IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) : un autre mode d'échange de courrier électronique.  IRC (Internet Relay Chat) : protocole de discussion instantanée.  NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol) : protocole de transfert de message utilisé par les forums de discussion"}

Finalités de l’Internet Rappelons qu’un réseau Internet est une interconnexion des ordinateurs dans le monde permettant le travail collaboratif et/ou les échanges entre personnes géographiquement séparées. Ceci étant posé, l’Internet a été développé pour plusieurs raisons à savoir :  La connectivité : C’est une technique qui permet à plusieurs types d’équipements informatiques utilisant des logiciels différents de communiquer entre eux,  Le partage des ressources : C’est un procédé qui permet la segmentation d’un système informatique pouvant être employée par différents utilisateurs. Autrement dit, C’est rendre accessible à une communauté d'utilisateurs des programmes, des données et des équipements informatiques (i.e. un ensemble de ressources) indépendamment de leur localisation.  La modularité : (Ajout graduel des performances), elle consiste à utiliser un ensemble restreint d’appareils généraux pour tester leurs performances.  L’implantation simple : C’est une solution générale qui permet d’installer aisément et sans aucune difficulté les équipements informatiques selon leurs différentes configurations.  L’utilisation facile : C’est une disponibilité d’outils de communication libérant les utilisateurs de la connaissance de la structure du réseau ;  La fiabilité7 : C’est la capacité de détection et correction d’un dispositif à fonctionner sans défaillance (sauvegardes, duplication). Autrement dit, C’est une disposition du fonctionnement même en cas de problèmes matériels (c’est par exemple, les applications militaires, bancaires, le contrôle des centrales nucléaires ou aérien...).  Une mise à jour aisée : C’est un procédé qui permet aux réseaux informatiques d’évoluer et d’être modifiée selon les besoins des utilisateurs et des nouveaux équipements.  La réduction des coûts : l’accès à distance des matériels informatiques a considérablement réduit les coûts de ces derniers, en permettant ainsi aux différents utilisateurs de s’en procurer au prix standard (le PC, par exemple). 7 En informatique par exemple, la fiabilité s’exprime par une durée qui correspond au temps moyen de bon fonctionnement d’un équipement.

Le problème de la communication entre les personnes et les services sont capital pour les entreprises depuis toujours, désormais l’adoption du travail sur l’Internet est capable de lui apporter une réponse définitive. Ainsi, parmi les principaux avantages de l’Internet, on peut citer :  Une meilleure communication (Facile et rapide) : Grâce à l’internet, La communication entre les personnes est dorénavant plus aisée et l’information circule plus librement pour tout le monde y compris les différentes collaborations entre les entreprises et pour ne citer que cela. Mêmes les personnes travaillant dans des distincts endroits, en voyage ou chez eux, peuvent aussitôt se connecter au réseau et communiquer plus facilement en utilisant les supports et matériels de communication (tels que, les emails, la messagerie instantanée, les lignes téléphoniques, la vidéoconférence ou le Skype…) pour pleinement en profiter.  Une Optimisation et gain du temps : l’Internet permet identiquement d’améliorer et de gagner du temps sur le partage des fichiers et des données informatiques. Dorénavant, les utilisateurs arrivent à trouver et partager les données dont ils ont besoin. Depuis des années, cette fonctionnalité du réseau internet est devenue la plus utilisée par les grandes organisations afin de maintenir leurs données d’une manière organisée facilitant les accès à distance pour les personnes souhaitées.  Une productivité accrue : Un réseau Internet permet de donner à toute activité humaine, une vitesse d’exécution assez importante de la tâche ; l’exactitude et la fiabilité des outils informatiques entrainent des économies du temps et d’argent à tous les niveaux de l’activité humaine, particulièrement l’allégement des tâches à effectuer. Tout de même, il implique une communication permettant aux équipes professionnelles de se consacrer foncièrement à leurs missions. Beaucoup d’obstacles qui entravaient jusqu’alors la productivité tombent d’eux-mêmes, et les énergies de l’entreprise peuvent alors se concentrer sur les véritables objectifs.

Il est tout aussi possible, pour qui le veut, de faire des mises à jour de tous ces fichiers conservés.

In this sense, the problem regarding responsibility of or for AI raises the very question of what a decision is. The problem also connects with issues about delegation: we delegate decisions to machines. But what does this delegation entail in terms of responsibility? (2) Indeed, this case is more complicated since one could argue that the delegate is then still responsible for that particular task—at least to some extent—and it may not be clear how the responsibility is distributed in such cases.
